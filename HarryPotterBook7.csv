"1","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"," Jun 03 2011"," Lora","it was amazing"," I m going to keep this brief since there isn t much to say that hasn t already been said clears throat I think the reason I waited so long to read this series is because I just couldn t imagine myself enjoying reading about an eleven-year-old boy and his adventures at a school of wizardry I thought it would be too juvenile for my taste I was wrong of course I can honestly say that I loved every minute of this It s a spectacular little romp with funny courageous and endearing characters that you can t help but love It has talking chess pieces singing hats a giant three-headed dog named Fluffy a hilarious giant with a dragon fetish a master wizard that s just a little bit crazy mail carrier owls goblins running a bank unicorns centaurs trolls and probably much more that I m forgetting And then there s the lead characters Hermione the young scholar who starts out prim and up-tight but soon becomes a true friend Ron the boy who has little money but who has an abundance of family and loyalty to his friends to make up for it and then there s Harry the boy who starts out sleeping in a closet and ends up being a hero Harry is kind to those that deserve it fearless when it counts the most and wonderfully intelligent What s not to love In regards to the ending view spoiler I feel silly saying this about a middle grade novel but I didn t suspect Quirrell a bit If there were hints that he was the true culprit and not Snape I obviously missed them hide spoiler FAVORITE QUOTE But from that moment on Hermione Granger became their friend There are some things you can t share without ending up liking each other and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them Now if you ll excuse me I m off to start Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets My reviews of other titles in this series Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets more"
"2","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"," Jun 10 2012"," Khanh first of her name mother of bunnies","it was amazing"," Rereading for the 3rd time for the group read Once upon a time there was a 10th grader named Khanh who didn t get along with people very well She wasn t an outcast in school and all the bullying and teasing stopped with the commencement of high school but she had always been a bookworm and has generally preferred the company of her own thoughts Lunchtime had always been dedicated not to eating but to sitting in the library browsing through books Not to worry she got her nutrition in 5th period in the form of a giant 6-inch M M studded cookie and a package of Sour Patch Kids and or a package of Reese s Pieces Ah the effortless metabolism of youth One day there were shiny new books on her school library s New Releases shelf Harry Potter books 1 through 3 She had heard of the books before of course since they were a constant presence on the NYT bestsellers list but she had always avoided them thinking of them as children s novels At the grand age of 14 surely she was too old for a little kid s fantasy novel She had read the Outlander series earlier that year after all And it had sex in it SEX She didn t really quite understand everything in the book but the point is she had read them Surely at 14 Khanh was ready for more mature novels And that did not include Harry Potter Harry Potter is 11 Khanh is 14 There is a vast difference in their ages Khanh was a teenager dammit But the Harry Potter books were new Brand new They were shiny they had never been touched by another reader And Khanh was tempted She picked up the first book in the series Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone The end Or rather the beginning more"

"10","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"," Dec 10 2009"," Jess","it was amazing"," My original review was a comparison of sorts between Harry Potter and Twilight However this is stupid as the two are incomparable Honestly its not even worth discussing Its not just that Twilight doesn t come close it is the fact that Harry Potter transcends other similar works Its peerless To quote Samuel L Jackson in Pulp Fiction It ain t the same fuckin ballpark it ain t the same league it ain t even the same fuckin sport There was a day when I thought I needed to defend Harry Potter in the midst of the now dead Twilight craze and you can see that below in what was my original review It is a testament to the power of this series that while various other franchises Twilight Hunger Games have surged into popularity and then faded Harry Potter remains unwaveringly strong after nineteen years It is clear readers hold just as much admiration for these books as they always have Time has not dimmed that I will one day write an essay about what these books mean to me Eternal this is the one that started it all Original review circa 2010 A note in regard to the on-going Potter vs Twilight debate Go ahed tell me Twilight is better Tell me that James is scarier than Voldemort That the Cullens are a better family than the Weasly s That Edward is cooler than Harry and Bella is smarter than Hermione Tell me that Stephenie Meyer is more talented than J K Rowling Go ahead I dare you Those who think the topic of Harry Potter or Twilight is worth debating and arguing over are utterly stupid Quite frankly-this book is amazing more"

"16","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"," Jan 08 2013"," Matthew","it was amazing"," One of my first jobs was at a bookstore When I was a kid my Mom would take me to the mall and I would spend tons of time hanging out at Waldenbooks who here remembers Waldenbooks Right when I became legally old enough to work I went in and submitted my application and a few weeks later I was selling literature to the masses Why do I tell you this story on this review you ask Well at the time young adult teen literature consisted mainly of RL Stein Christopher Pike Beverly Cleary Judy Blume and a few other classic Newberry Award winners but certainly we did not have a YA section to the extent you see it today Towards the end of my tenure at Waldenbooks - as Oprah s book club was hitting its stride and Men Are From Mars Women Are From Venus was in its bazzilionth week on the New York Times best seller list - a book display arrived featuring a buzzy new title about a certain boy wizard I remember the display at the front of the store and selling a few copies but I didn t realize what it would become A few years later early 2000s I had kinda gotten out of the loop on what was big in books I had just finished college which had taken up most of my free reading time A friend of mine named Bronco yup real name not a nickname who also was the Best Man at my wedding had a copy of this book on his coffee table Holy cow Here is that same book we were selling at Waldenbooks about 5 years before - what was he doing with it Well he said it was good so I borrowed it I quickly plowed through the first 4 books and then got the pleasure of joining the world in waiting for the release of Order of the Phoenix And I noticed when I went to the bookstore the YA section and selection was not so small anymore I truly believe it was Harry Potter that opened the door to get more young adults and even adults of course reading and authors interested in writing for that genre more"
"17","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"," Sep 12 2014"," Mohammed Arabey","it was amazing"," It s Always Great Coming back Home There s a reason us the Fans feel that we re connected no matter where we from different culture ethics ages we re all graduated from there Hogwarts even like we were in same class classmates no matter which edition we read Cause Harry Potter is not just a story it s a Life The Boy Who Saved Flourished the Book IndustryIt s One of the most important novels in modern history Sorry it s The Most Important ONE This Review also for those who hate the series Please bear with me Without it most Book stores publishers may have the same fate of Video Stores like Blockbuster LLC which despite being super popular in the 90s closed all the stores by 2013 shutting down forever Yes without this Novel and with the rapid change in technology the ease of making e-books and reading it in PCs Smartphones Tablets etc the publishing and trade of new paper books may decrease rapidly It d be limited for religious or educating books classics small novels Even those could be just electronic too and the Books be just like Good Ol Video Tapes A Dystopia right very gloomy idea to the world without This novel The One Well in the case you think I m exaggerate Let s have A Brief History of Literature in the 90s------------------------------- Well let s back to early 90s where TV is in every house even in every room Video sets are there too rental video stores everywhere satellite receivers and cable channels growing fast packed with channels for kids teenagers making them attached more more into screens not to mention Video Games Game boy and Nintendo Those of this new generation who read are weirdos or nerds to the rest of their peers And for those few who read book stores mostly got for them comics and graphic novels which most of them created early this century Classic Novels they read just for Schools and Classes mostly And New Novels that make Best Seller are the ones made or will be made into movies for Julia Roberts Tom Cruse or any of the 90s Hollywood celebrity or the ones by Stephen King because of course will be made into movies too Even these new novels didn t live up the selling numbers of Tolkien Charles Dickens Agatha Christie -what s with the British authors and selling numbers - also in Russia no more Dostoevsky and Tolstoy no more Hugo in France in Egypt no more like Naguib Mahfouz the great authors of the 50s to 70s No new Big Hit for novels most of the selling books are those of Speculation about strange mysterious things in the world or in religion Dream interpretation cocking books or celebrities rumors While in US UK Top Selling books mostly the Self Help ones or those teaching Computers Programming and Web Sites -this brand new huge technology leap back then-No new novels to attract the new generation of kids and teenagers There s few Successful Highlights though like R L Stine s Goosepumbs in 1992 which made a very good success and translated in many countries including Egypt And in Egypt there s also a very successful project by respectful Publishing house that made Pocket Novels for youth by brilliant Egyptian writers presenting huge variety of novels of many genres Sci-Fi Action Thriller comics Romance etc There s also Reading for All project by the first lady Susan Mubarak reprinting a huge verity of important books and novels from all over the world in very cheap prices But all these effort didn t attract more and more of new youth readers as intended it just made more and more books for those few who already reads The vast numbers of those who don t just read will increase if there isn t a BIG new attractive Reading Experience to get them into reading specially with the more channels more movies But the BIGGEST Obstacle for them to read came out in 1994 and became a real phenomenon by 1995 it s Playstation The giant Japanese Gaming leap Football Crash Pepsi man even the comics heroes also have their games so why reading Superman Batman s comics when you can play them A beat So by 1996 with this growing leap in Gaming also the Computer 3D games getting much improved Books get replaced bit by bit by a gaming controls So do you think it s wise for publishers to publish a book for new writer Of course not it may not even cover it s publishing cost So it was very normal when in this year 1996 when Joanne a 31 years old lady from England handed the manuscript of her first novel to 12 publishing houses all of them rejected it A manuscript of over 200 pages of a novel that she had hard times in her personal and professional life while writing it and for children Seriously is there still any Child left who still read it s 1996 the Era of Playstation and Video Games But then the Modest Bloomsbury agreed to publish it with 2 advises for her first that she d get a day job since it s a little chance of making money in children s books - later she received a grant from the Scottish Arts Council to help her continuing writing -But the significant advice was to change her pen name cause young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman So with her name her grandmother s Kathleen come the 2 initial of her pen name J k Rowling And in 26 June 1997 with 1 000 copies 500 of which were distributed to libraries come out in UK to our World The Greatest Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone And Bam everything happened so fast Before the end of this year the novel was awarded many important literary awards in the UK An American important publisher Scholastic won the rights to publish the novel in US with a huge check Rowling would never dreams of Just with small change Philosopher s Stone to be Sorcerer s Stone as the American publisher feared Philosopher s may not be that attractive to young readers And Thanks to Harry Potter now Every young readers worldwide know much more about Philosopher s Stone s legend In 1998 Book Two released in UK 1999 in US winning more literary prizes And becoming NO 1 Top Selling Book in UK US and many other countries which start to publish the translated first book And on 8 July 1999 The First Breaking Record made when Book Three sold 68 000 copies in just three days after its release in the United Kingdom and more copies when it released late 1999 in US With the fast growing popularity of Harry Potter among readers more records had been broken The 3 books takeover the Top Spot in all charts of Best Selling Books for weeks months and it s even still in hardcover editions This conquer of the Top Spots made some literary magazines newspapers separate the Harry Potter books selling records from the rest of the top selling books splitting the lists into Children Books and Adult Books sections under pressure from other publishers who were eager to see their books given higher ranking And then it was year 2000 where everything is about to change forever The Playstation 2 is out there and even higher leap in Computer Games But even with this much of temptations thousands of children teens and parents gathered in the Midnight of 8 July 2000 in UK and US at the same day in front of stores not in front of Cinemas as usual not electronic stores as Apple stores as happening theses days But it was in front of Bookstores for The First time in the Book Stores History to buy a copy of Harry Potter and the Goblet of FireAnd They didn t mind to find out that the book is over 700 page it was even for their pleasure more than double the size of any of the first 3 novels double the thriller double the fun Over 3 million copies sold at that day only in the US a New World Record totally unexpected one Huge story bigger plot mysterious and very well written And more literate prizes for Rowling more translated editions to more than 40 language And a huge budget for the upcoming first movie of the series which beautifully visualize the magic of the novel by the faithful producers and the director and it also made some Cinematic Records back then but that s not our subject now With the announcement of pushing the publishing date of Book Five to mid 2003 and with 2 movies out so far The Hunger for reading Harry Potter kept on So As more readers from this generation start to increase Publishers and Book Stores start to promote for more books for those readers who are hungry for more Older Fantasy books like Lord of the Rings -which was a super successful movie by then too- Narnia Golden Compass and many other novels start getting more reprinted editions And so Book Stores prosperity increased as it get more and more readers More countries welcomed the Harry Potter phenomenon The English edition AND the local translated ones both been sold everywhere worldwide Even in Egypt English edition sold at many books stores And hopefully some New Book Stores specialized in English novels and books start to open in Cairo Alexandria by 2002-2003 And in summer 2002 after the Movie wild success Nahdet Masr publishing house got the rights and published the Arabic edition Although it cut some of the lines for length issues the edition still hold the magic of it making a very good sales The good news is the literary movement didn t stop there Harry Potter and Reprinted Classics No there s more new books come out for the increasing demand from the readers By 2002 Life of Pi Man Booker winner make very good sales numbers And in April 2003 Dan Brown previously published 3 novels making good sales released a novel that made Huge Fuss around and making a new sales records The Da Vinci Code The funny thing that there s a reference in this novel that Harry Potter is the Second Most Selling Book in History after the Bible a speculation that happens to be true in less than 5 years after that A month later May 2003 Khaled Hosseini released his first novel The Kate Runner which also made a very good records too -Don t you agree if there s no Harry Potter before this Afghan-born author would have a chance He d be rejected by 12 publishers like you know who - And all that didn t affect the main reason for this new Literal Renaissance All that didn t affect the Records Breaker to break records one month later On 20 June 2003 book Five Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix comes out Ten thousands of all ages conquer the Book Stores in UK US and other countries too at the same day to get The One Book they ve been waiting for at least 2 years Shipping agents like FedEx made the delivery to many countries to get the book at the same time A New world Record 5 millions copy at the first day only For the first time in France a non french language book placed in no 1 of the bestselling book Some kids got a headache called Harry Potter Headache as they read the whole 850 pages of the book five the biggest so far at the same day without resting And in Egypt September the same year the Arabic edition of book three comes out with unexpected sales records first edition run out of the stores by the first week only though it s nearly the beginning of the School year and the movie of this 3rd book still filming And the price of it get higher 20 in 2 days and still with increasing demand More English books and novels sold in Egypt too along with the Arabic ones publishing more books for new Egyptian authors and writers along with more of the famous ones Alaa El Aswany s debut Novel Yaqubean s Building making a very good selling numbers And in July 2004 the Arabic edition of Book Four makes a price war between book stores and magazines stands January 2005 an abridged translated edition of Book Five make many readers angry in Egypt specially that many already read the English edition before so the publisher release an unabridged one by May And on 21 July 2005 A Higher Record that breaks all the previously ones 6 9 million copy of Book Six sold in US in its first day only A huge book it may not be as the fans expectations of being full of action but it get a twist that blow minds about one of the most interesting characters Professor Snape That made many fans and even big authors like Stephen King and Salman Rushdie talk about for months With Pre-Final Book of Harry Potter is out it followed by a massive variety of New Novels New Series New Authors Twilight series Percy Jackson series and much more more Books Sales not only in US UK but worldwide More Novels hit the top sales A Real Prosperity But still Harry Potter is the Records Big Breaker At the midnight before 21 June 2007 Everywhere around

and total sales of 11 millions copies in UK and US in the first day only The book sold at the Same Day almost in Every Single Country even in Israel which made a big religious fuss because the Book

That s what Rowling wrote at the very early pages of her first book The one that rejected by 12 Publishing Houses in 1996 Well what about now God Talked too much in the Brief introduction didn t I

"18","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"," Jan 27 2010"," K D Absolutely","really liked it"," How can more than half of my Goodreads friends be wrong with this I have to get this right As of this writing I have 98 Goodreads friends 61 62 of them have read J K Rowling s Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone Out of those who read this 39 64 rated this with 5 stars 11 of them with 4 stars All the others gave 3 or 2 Only 2 rated this with 1 star One of them admitted not being able to finish it She should not have rated it really since she did not read its entirety But she is my friend and it is her right so why question When the book came out in 1998 I was not yet a bookworm so I brushed this aside I read only those books that my brother told me to read He was the bookworm but he would not be caught reading any book being pushed by media hype However when Warner Bros released the film adaptation in 2001 my daughter was 6 years old and I thought that since there was too much hype the movie must be good and we would have a memorable time with our first ever father-daughter movie date I was wrong She not only got scared because of the darkness inside the movie house but she trembled with fear during the life-size human chess game in that scene when Ron was sacrificed We left the movie in that scene with my daughter crying and me cursing it I will never read Harry Potter My daughter is now 15 going 16 She is not fond of movies and she still does not show interest on reading Harry Potter However I am now a bookworm and the other week I was with my 4 Goodreads friends and 3 of them raved two of them again about Harry Potter books Oh well first-time fathers can make mistakes about first movie date with their daughters Book 1 is included in 500 Must Read Books and the book must be a quick read So the following day I bought my copy After 13 years of the book s existence and me ignoring it did I finally make a good decision of reading it Are all of those 39 friends of mine in Goodreads wrong in giving this 5 stars Most of them did not bother writing a review Maybe those would be too long or maybe they read this when they were not in Goodreads yet But I am in Goodreads already so I can make this review long These are what some of them say it was a great book i enjoyed reading it For an eloquent reviewer she must have been too happy to express herself Such a great story and creative way of writing I love Harry Potter Yes I agree about the story being great and J K Rowling being creative I was secretly wishing I was studying in Hogwarts too It was silly but I was simply enraptured by Harry Potter Honestly I still am It was a great book I enjoyed reading it Coming from one of my favorite reviewers in Goodreads I do not share her wanting to be a sorcerer though Honestly I don t know anybody who d refuse to even entertain the thought of attending a school for wizards Another one of my favorite reviewers That seems to have nailed this Young people wanting to be in Hogwarts and study sorcery That should be it The world seems to be a dreadful place that we would all like to have powers to turn our enemies into frogs pigs ride on a broomstick and get the Snitch and earn points money for our family Oh well the Bible says that sorcery is Satan s work The book even used the word Transfiguration as a subject in the sorcery school Blasphemy Just kidding This is a work of fiction and I am not too old to appreciate it I was just kidding To be frank I tried hard not to like this I thought that giving this a 1 or 2 will freak out my friends and somehow get votes from those who are up to now ignoring this book I told you so Why waste your time However unless you are a grumpy old man woman there is nothing not to like about this book I maybe too old for it but hey talent is talent and J K Rowling has it My 39 friends are indeed right more"
"19","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"," Feb 16 2009"," Stephen","liked it"," On my list of reasons why my daughters are the bestest thing to ever happen to me Number 14 577 is that they gave me at 41 years old the perfect excuse to revisit the Harry Potter series When my oldest angel told me she wanted to start reading the Harry Potter books I couldn t have been happier As I was collecting all seven volumes off the shelf to bring up to her room I started feeling nostalgic for the whole Hogwarts gang and I realized that I d never done more than a perfunctory review of this first volume I figured it was high time to rectify that oversight Harry deserves it However with over a million ratings and almost two reviews for every day I ve been alive I think I can dispense with any plot distillation or character profiles It has all been eloquently said before Therefore I just want to briefly express what I see as the essential magic at the heart of the series and why I think it has resonated so strongly with so many people Here goes Only rarely does a story come along that can so completely wrap you up in a warm blanket of contentment and good feelings One that can hold at bay even if only for precious moments the nasty brutishness of what often passes for daily life These stories do that It s an escape into a world of optimism honor and hope where things always look hopeful and anything is possible Who wouldn t want to hang around in a place like that especially when it is decorated with sorting hats kindly giants magic wands and Quidditch Granted no aspect of the story is revolutionary or even particularly noteworthy from the standpoint of blazing new trails within the fantasy genre It isn t great literature and nothing about its technical merits makes it befitting of even a fraction of its unprecedented success Fine acknowledged And So what The virtue of this story is the postive feelings it conjures in its readers Harry s story is something that radiates acceptance inclusion and friendship It invokes a sense of belonging Inside these pages you can find the impetus to see the better angels of humanity s nature and feel just a little better about the world around you How is that not worthy of praise As for Harry himself he s just a good kid The quintessential everyman who makes good A loving boy with a clear head on his shoulders and a caring heart that pumps affection for the world around him He s someone you can t help but like He s not perfect He makes mistakes he s occasionally short sighted and I know many of us wish he would stick up for himself a little more Maybe reduce his aunt and uncle to a pair of fatty stains on the carpet or give Dudley an atomic wedgie until his skivvies scrape against his pancreas But that s not Harry He s a better person than that That s why we love him Maybe all of the above is a bit much Like I said I was feeling nostalgic and maybe the gush got a tad away from me Let s just say that these stories are perfect comfort food and reading them will make you happy I ll certainly settle for that As for the rating I Initially only gave this first volume 3 stars and I m not going to change that now As much as I love the series as a whole I don t think it reaches stratospheric heights until Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Still this is where it all began As such it should be read and savored knowing that it only gets better 3 0 stars Highly Recommended more"
"20","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"," Aug 30 2016"," maggie","it was amazing"," This boy will be famous There won t be a child in our world who doesn t know his name Everyone grew up with Harry Potter They read all the books when they were young and watched all the films They would re-watch and re-read them They would fall in love with the Wizarding World and would completely adore Harry Ron and Hermione They would talk about them non stop about Hogwarts about its teachings about them wanting to become students there and pretending they are about joining the HP fandom about loving every character and instantly missing the world Everyone would adore Harry Potter and knew about it since they were young ones Except me I didn t grow up with Harry Potter Not because I didn t get to but because I chose not to I know it s like living a life where everything has been a lie Worse even It s just the movies would appear on my tv From the first one to the next and the next and every time I saw the trailer for the upcoming one I wouldn t be interested and would skip it when I came to it I wouldn t bother and wouldn t care and that made a big problem in my life now Here I am now being left out because of such poor choices and decisions I made when I was 7 8 9 and older until now But now as 2016 and having over 500 friends that are caught up and have read the recently published novel Harry Potter and the Cursed Child I have finally read the first book and am able to continue the series and watch the films Now here I am wishing to go back to my past and change this nightmare and actually watch the films or read the books because I have literally missed on so much missed too much and have been missing too much I have been out of this world and never realized how good it is and how special it already has become There is no good and evil there is only power and those too weak to seek it I find it stupid of me to write a review for Harry Potter especially being the first one I also find it stupid of me how I just recently decided to check this out and finally read it But still I guess I can still write a review Of course my thoughts would be quite similar to everyone else Thoughts and opinions nothing negative maybe maybe not But here goes nothing Harry Potter is one of the most famous loved and top series out there It is loved adored cherished and amazing for HP fans every time they read it No matter how many times it is read it fills the person s heart with warmth and happiness as they are going back to the wizarding world As for me I have finally entered it and feel young and new and early to this because I am new to this all Other than that Harry Potter is considered a Children s book but in my opinion it s in between middle grade and young adult because it can be hard to read for some Although it was very very easy for me to read and understand I see myself reading this all these years before and having a lot of trouble pronouncing some names Harry Potter a story about a young wizard that didn t even know he was a wizard Harry Potter a 10 year-old boy who turned 11 is living with his horrible rude and awful family The Dursleys Mrs Dursley is known as Harry Potter s mother s sister The problem is they didn t like each other nor blend in with each other They were different Her sister was a witch while she was just a Muggle a person who cannot seek the magic and find it nothing and no one special because they aren t able to turn things into other things aren t able to fly on a broom cast a robe on fire defeat a villain confuse a troll aren t able to do anything really Well she wasn t besides treat Harry with such disrespect and treat her ugly and fat son with such caress and would spoil him because he was such a little brat that would get what he wants Really though There would be 36 presents under a Christmas tree and as he counts them he pouts and is upset because it s less than what he had the year before DUDE I BARELY GET A BARNES AND NOBLE GIFT CARD CHILL The reason for Harry living with this family and having to go trough all this trouble and mess is because he was actually given to them by Professor Albus Dumbledore known as one of the greatest wizards and the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry When Harry was a baby his parents were killed by Everyone-Knows-Who but as he tried killing Harry he really wasn t able to His mother was killed because she was trying to stop him but as he tried killing Harry he couldn t bare to do it and left him a scar the scar that has made Harry known and popular for surviving this evil person Once saved and taken the only people they can rely on are The Dursleys and as Harry grows they expect them to tell him he is a wizard and tell him everything and fix all the lies Except they don t As days pass Harry has been getting letters from someone he doesn t know He doesn t know who it is and what they want but he knows there is something going on due to the amount of letters being sent After getting the chance to open the first one his Uncle Vernon decides to snatch it away from him read it and burn it He knows he knows who it is and what they want but he doesn t want Harry to know But even with him burning letter by letter and collecting them all letters keep arriving and arriving until the person finally shows up face-to-face with The Dursleys and Harry on his 11th birthday He s huge introduced as a half-giant and half-human known as Rubeus Hagrid Hagrid is the one who tells Harry the truth telling him he is a wizard and a well-known one as well He s got talent and has some of the same abilities as his parents One being a witch and the other being a wizard Harry is known as a wizard as well And as Hagrid tells him the truth Harry does too He doesn t know what he is talking about and doesn t know what is going on He doesn t believe he is a wizard and doesn t believe the reason for his parent s deaths But of course Hagrid decides to tell him the truth and tell him his parents did not die on a car crash for that seemed impossible but they were killed by Everyone-Knows-Who and is the reason for his scar His aunt finally admitting herself into being a witness of knowing the truth got everything out of her chest and was able to tell him the truth She wouldn t even mention her sister because she pretended to not have one She was considered perfect and brave while she was nothing and unnoticed Nothing has changed but she didn t even bother trying to care care of her niece as her sister is dead protecting Harry from wherever she is And as Hagrid tells Harry the rest he actually takes Harry with him even when Mr Dursley forbids him He can t do anything since he is a Muggle and Harry has already been accepted to Hogwarts School and nothing can change When Harry leaves with Hagrid they go and buy him what he needs including clothes and supplies for the school As they go to the shop he is introduced as Harry himself but is instantly known by everyone else Everyone is pleased to meet him and feel proud because they have shaken his hand He s famous his name is everywhere and he can be considered a legend for what happened But even with all this going on Harry is still a little confused and figuring things out As Harry and Hagrid get what they need it s time for Harry to go to school where he meets Ron Weasley as to what I know one of his best friends Ron is small red-haired has freckles pale and has two twin brothers going to Hogwarts with him He s not accepted into the other groups and that is why he blends in with Harry and becomes his friend Harry also meets Hermione Granger known as someone annoying and as a nightmare to them both because of how bossy and unrealistic she can be Of course they are all so small and Hermione is a little nerd that enjoys every teaching at this school so I was just like we get it Days pass and Harry is being trained He s a neutral to broom-stick flying is able to play Quidditch the most popular game in Hogwarts is given special supplies and is of course known by everyone Other than that Harry suspects his own secrets and wants to find out truths but in order to do that he must find a way to find them and figure them out With the help of his two friends he might just be able to figure out the real reason behind him being a wizard more about his parents history about himself who this You-Know-Who person is remember his past and see how his life really will be changed forever Humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them Harry Potter was easy to read understand and there was no hesitation when it came to rating it 5 stars Now I hate myself once again and ask myself again Why the fuck did I not read this earlier The answer is obvious because I already know it and it s because I was never a fan of it I hate speaking about my past but this is one ugly past and I hate it I hate the choice I made and I hate myself for allowing it But soon I ll get over it and will be able to re-read this as many times as I will be able to during my last 3 years of being a teen Yes a 15 year-old that has not read Harry Potter simply because she chose not to when she was able to and when she was young PATHETIC The fantasy is cute I will say It s easy to understand and the book is easy to fly through It s not long it s not hard and it s not boring It s gripping fun and everything is filled with some kind of magical element that has me turning page by page Having no regrets anywhere I am finally able to talk about HP and the world of wizards where students learn how to make potions talk to ghosts learn about other creatures transform things into other things read minds become invisible fly in the air with a broomstick play soccer in the air have a feast and enjoy it all learn magic have a wand and just be filled with happiness because of the friends and families considered in the houses Well I guess in most Everything was fun to read I laughed at some parts and found the story to be more affective to me as Harry was figuring out his new and changed life He was confused but he found out a lot more There s still more but I know that as he grows I will be able to follow along the late ass journey and see where he grows to and how I ll see how strong he gets and find out some strengths and weakness I ll be able to join an invisible magic carpet and fly through the series because I just want to know what happens next and how everything goes I want to see Harry become a better person and be able to prove Draco and his stupid friends wrong about what they think I want his friendship with Ron to grow and become stronger I want Hermione to stop being so talkative and take a little break of being so bossy But more importantly I want to have a fun journey reading this and feeling like I m on an adventure Reading it for the first time feels like one I ve never watched the films I ve watched parts but skipped them Now I won t skip anything It s like an adventure where I m dived in and can t seem to leave because I m so alive and intrigued What can I say about Harry Potter that others have not said Nothing Reviews are always similar and this one might be too Everyone loves it and so did I So will I I should say Yes I had trouble pronouncing some names at first but got used to it after Yes I rolled my eyes at times because there were moments where I was annoyed But nothing was boring and even when I rolled my eyes there was a reason for that eye rolling scene Maybe it was Hermione being annoying or Draco being a rude boy mocking an adorable red-haired Or both But I was also laughing I would always laugh when it came to Hagrid Since the beginning I instantly loved him and considered him hilarious I love how he turned Dunley into a pig but failed because he was already too much of a pig I remember laughing and noticing my parents looked at me weirdly but that s okay because I needed a novel where I was happy and ended up laughing at times Oh and also Hagrid is honestly so nice and adorable guys I love him He s so funny and protective and is such a good friend to Harry I loved everything he did for him and was glad he was the first one to introduce himself to Harry He cared for him since he was a baby and saw him as 11 bring him a present and giving him another one at the end Ron is honestly the cutest I don t understand how anyone could be mean to him He may be weak but he has his own strengths He s so adorable and small and I hated how Draco treated him There were some times unnecessary and I hated Draco for it but I ll probably end up loving Draco some time throughout the series and probably regret it because I know he s still gonna be really mean throughout the series I m sure I haven t spoiled myself so I have no idea how his or anyone else s life goes but I do know that he changes in some way Hermione is a small and cute nerd as well but sometimes I hated how sassy she was and bossy She hated losing points for her house and because she Ron and Harry were in the same house they had to work together and find a way to become friends to find out other truths and earn points for Gryffindor She took everything very serious and showed off at times because of her perfect test grades and assignments but I was glad she was able to put up with Ron and Harry while they put up with her Malfoy Draco was someone I did not like at all Like I said he mocked and made fun of Ron and I hated him for it He showed off as well but in the bad way thinking he was really cool just because he s in Slytherin and how used to the wizarding world he is He didn t show much care about Harry and his past and would try to get in a fight with Harry while Harry tried fixing the problem He payed no attention and took it too far with Harry He was a newbie as well so I don t see what the point was But the other point is that I don t have expectations for Draco but I hope I don t end up hating him in all books and hope there is some change at least slightly good The friendship between Harry Ron and Hermione was probably one of my favorites I know it didn t work out at first and they honestly hated her but I was so happy it literally had to work toward the middle Thanks to the troll she became their friend and actually was able to cooperate with them She didn t yell at them for fighting the troll but instead told them to be careful and send word if anything goes wrong when Harry went for the mirror again As it was ending she was saying goodbye to Harry and Ron and was even awkward because she couldn t really figure out what to say But also my heart was really happy when she hugged Harry because it felt real and it felt like something I had been waiting since the beginning It was friendship goals as they were becoming friends and it just made me happy seeing them all together same house same team same classes The writing of course is like I said easy to understand There were no words that were confusing in any way or words that got me mixed up because of how similar they sounded and there were no problems I didn t know what was gonna happen next and I know books are always better than movies but I will watch the films after or after finishing one book just to see the differences I hear they are kind of the same just that the book provides some more information and detail Like always it s no surprise There are some things you can t share without ending up liking each other and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them Overall I am so proud of myself for getting the first book over with now wanting the 2nd and the 3rd and the rest Really excited to see where this all goes to and how Harry becomes a better wizard more"

in trouble A detention in the forbidden forest meeting the Centaurs and their mystic creepy speakings of how Mars was Bright that night And finally there -which happens again by mere chance- they will learn the real reason of the whole fuss around the parcel The Philosopher s Stone and who is behind the attempts to steal it Chapter 16 THROUGH THE TRAPDOORChapter 17 THE MAN WITH TWO FACES So now the perfect well structured Mystery and investigations and the cleverly paced School year comes to an end Right after the fast nostalgic too summing up of the Exams days which was so realistic So Classic And then the plan is On after the exam For the big Action of this Magical enchanting plot of the first book and with all the tension there the spontaneous natural fun lines between the friends never ceased Even in the hardest parts can makes you smile This amazing ultimate real meaning of friends completing one another That s what can really help in facing Evil and not fearing death And choose well As Professor Dumbledore s wise talk And Love and being Loved is the strongest power of all to face anything So it was story of Love Friendship Family and Bravery A perfect conclusion for a Perfect First Book in Unforgettable Breaking Point in modern Fantasy Young Adult Novels And in novels History generally A story that touched me personally and may touched so many felt so connected to those amazing realistic characters And as the investigations part ends finally it was moment for Truth -that may remind you with Agatha s Poirot Quote The truth however ugly in itself is always curious and beautiful to seekers after it So we still won t have the full answers we seek and have in our mind such as If this is a great story Why would a Man even so evil as Voldemort would be that keen to kill baby Harry that much in the first place Will he return Will it be convenience one Well in later books you ll see that everything is connected mostly -NOT TOTALLY-planned from the beginning Well if you still think this is an overrated Book Series and doubt the accuracy of this first line then you re seriously have some Uncle Vernon Dursley blood in you But cheers you are Perfectly Normal Thank You Very Much Mohammed ArabeyFirst Read Sep 2002Illustrated Ed Read from 11 Nov 2015To 27 Nov 2015Full review of book one written in Nov 2016 more"
"43","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"," Nov 10 2016"," Brina","it was amazing"," Reposting in honor of Harry Potter s 20th anniversaryI have read Harry Potter more times than I have fingers and my two older children have read the entire series through twice These books have been around my entire adult life and because this first book was initially published prior to 2000 it is eligible as a modern classic group read in the group catching up on classics I have decided on this read through to rate the book within the middle grade children s genre and basing it against other books of its genre I rate this adventure five stars Earlier this year I decided to read classic and contemporary children s books in order to find quality books for my own children I did not want them to fall into the trap of only reading Harry Potter I may have found other timeless stories for them and culled new favorite authors however for a child Harry Potter stands out as an epic that allows an adolescent reader to grow up with its protagonists Additionally because the story has multitudes of plots sub plots and relatable characters Potter and his world generate many family discussions especially in a house as ours where multiple generations have read the story For myself it is becoming difficult to be as captivated by Harry s beginning years as I was when the books first came out I have reached the stage in life where Harry and friends are 19 years later Now years one through three become favorite stories for my children rather than myself My oldest turns eleven this year the same age Harry is in this story I myself have moved on to being thrilled by thousand page tomes like The Count and Gone With the Wind rather than books geared to adolescent readers And yet every so often it is still comforting to enter Harry s magical world for a few hours to put myself in my children s shoes and be able to share my love of reading with them Is Harry Potter a classic If years from now my grandchildren end up loving Harry as much as my kids do now I will be able to answer that question with a resounding yes In the meantime when I check out Harry from the library I will do so for my children rather than for myself I am thankful that I have finally reached a stage where I am captivated by a plethora of books not just one genre however I am glad that J K Rowling created this world so that kids can foster a love of reading and become lifelong readers For that nineteen years later I still rate The Sorcerer s Stone five magical stars more"

"59","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"," Oct 02 2008"," Nikki","liked it"," EDIT NOTE in 2012 Since this apparently isn t obvious I wrote the review years ago I do not necessarily have those opinions now I wouldn t know I haven t read Harry Potter since With a degree and five more birthdays behind me I do not necessarily agree with everything I said when I was seventeen years old I m happy to chat about the definition of literature with you or what I think about the Harry Potter phenomenon now or whatever but try and be civil and don t attack me right out of the gate EDIT NOTE in 2011 I ve edited this review to take out some teenage arrogance but the rest is as-is A few years later and with a degree in hand including modules in Children s Lit I could probably write a better review but people seem to like this one I really don t like Harry Potter It s one of those little concealed but apparently not widely known facts about me which shocks everyone when I say I love books and they re all yeah rite Harry Potter is so awesum rite and I say no it really isn t I confess when I was eleven or twelve or so I read them I also read the Sabrina the Teenage Witch novels I read everything and wasn t very discriminating about it I did enjoy them I continued to enjoy them until I got to Order of the Phoenix and then I decided that all the hype aside I just wasn t interested anymore Bear in mind then for the rest of this essay that I have only read up to and including The Goblet of Fire Cue a few years of irritation while everyone insisted I must read the rest of the books and how dare I prefer Tolkien and Ursula Le Guin and later Susan Cooper I have really no objection to people reading the books and enjoying them taking part in the fandom that surrounds them dressing up in witchy costumes to go and pick up the most recently released volume at midnight Have fun with that As far as I m concerned you re welcome to I m even quite happy to concede that yes Harry Potter did get more people reading Whether it got them reading literature or not is another matter how many people I wonder have discovered a mania for reading after reading Harry Potter and then gone onto the likes of Crime and Punishment and War and Peace or even Lord of the Rings Not that many I ll bet I think they re probably reading Twilight and the like more often than not Not that it matters -- as long as people are reading But in any case I Don t Have To Read Them Just because I like books does not mean I like those books And I detest it every time someone shoves them in my face as great literature I actually had to study Harry Potter for my English Lit Lang A Level for those unfamiliar with our system A Levels are exams you take when you re about eighteen which among other things determine whether you can go to university One of the questions we had to figure out how to answer was whether we thought Harry Potter was good literature whether we thought it would stand the test of time and how it was suited to the time it s currently in It was then that I figured out that yeah there are things wrong with Harry Potter beyond just the hype that was irritating me so much and the feeling that Rowling in no way matched up to the giants of fantasy and sci-fi like Tolkien I studied it alongside Tom Brown s Schooldays by Thomas Hughes Do note that I didn t like that book either But it s a well written well shaped well considered book -- and it doesn t use the same cheap tricks as Harry Potter does I m not going to say much about that since it s not a book I liked if I m going to compare contrast I ll compare with my favourite book that is also supposed to be for younger readers Susan Cooper s The Dark Is Rising There s nothing wrong with Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone being an amateur first novel cause that s what it is I m sure many people s first novels don t even see the light of day and yet Harry Potter somehow made it to a publisher s and was accepted The thing is people mostly refuse to recognise that and the cheap tricks J K Rowling uses For example her character s names Draco Malfoy Mal the French for bad immediately obvious Draco suggesting dragon Or perhaps draconian which has negative connotations aplenty not that I d necessarily attribute those particular ones to Draco Not very subtle is it Dumbledore Who doesn t get the image of a well-meaning if strange old man Minerva straight out of Greek myth a goddess of knowledge Gee I wonder why Rowling chose that for a female teacher Remus Lupin Sirius Black Mad-Eye Moody Do I even have to say anything And Harry Potter Nothing striking about that perfectly ordinary as names go right Yeah And that s the point Harry Potter himself is not a real character -- certainly not at first He s a cypher a convenient space into which a kid can very easily insert himself or even herself He s brave Okay generic hero characteristic He has doubts Again the same He has a Tragic Past Don t we all Or don t we all like to think we do Look at the Mary Sues self inserts people write in fandom -- so often they re people with incredibly dark melodramatic pasts that they rise above Harry Potter is a convenient place to insert yourself The other characters are archetypes more than anything -- Hermione the know it all girl Ron the loyal friend Dumbledore the mentor Malfoy the rival All of that is actually what makes Harry Potter a highly readable enjoyable book for young people and even adults It s targeted very precisely toward the readership of today Maybe that makes J K Rowling a better author than I might paint her as that she can know her audience so well -- there s that view I m sure But it s all very basic and I tend to look on it as cheap tricks The whole chapter in the first book about the Mirror of Erised -- how sad does it make you feel for Harry It s sentimental it s sad -- and it s meant to do that very obviously There s a whole chapter written just to enforce the love between the members of Harry Potter s family Susan Cooper does it in a single paragraph that makes me want to cry every single time I read it coming after all the build up of guilt and pain in the relationship Bran went to his father and put his arm round his waist and stood close It was the first gesture of affection between the two that Will had ever seen And wondering loving surprise woke in Owen Davies s worn face as he looked down at the boy s white head and the two stood there waiting That paragraph does for me what Rowling s whole chapter cannot It s so effective actually because Cooper spends a whole book leading up to it showing us Owen and Bran s relationship Rowling shows us Harry s parents but in an unsubtle way that actually throws me out of it because I think Oh yeah this is the chapter in which we re supposed to feel very sorry for Harry There s also a very easy blunt misdirection You re supposed to hate Snape supposed to believe he s the one to blame for everything and at the end you re supposed to be as surprised as Harry when it s Quirrel waiting there for him At the age of eleven I think I went right along with that but when I reread it for A Level I had to wince at how heavy-handed the misdirection was I understand that later in the series Snape comes into it more and I don t know whether the misdirection turns out to be not that misdirected when it comes down to the real truth but in the first book you re meant to believe it s Snape all along and I don t think J K Rowling does a very good job of giving us clues that it s not actually Snape because she s so busy blackening him to lead people astray It s also very black-and-white Questions aren t raised by this story -- and that s a thing I think is actually important in literature Raise questions discuss issues end with a question I don t know what to call stories that don t fit into that really I m going to go with novels as opposed to literature Harry Potter is a novel It s a story I don t think it has any real lasting values Susan Cooper s books while also quite basic discussing the Light and the Dark do end with a question If man is left on earth to do as man will will man be Light or Dark The immortals leave earth and say that the world -- for better or worse -- belongs to humans Right now a lot of people think the answer to that question would be worse But Harry Potter does not raise this question does not raise any question and does not answer one either That s why I don t think it will last except perhaps as a phenomenon to be studied the Potter mania and what caused it That s why I don t like Rowling s writing It s not particularly refined it s unsubtle -- and that s okay you know I m not saying you can t enjoy that can t find it refreshing I don t I m also not saying that novels are bad -- they re good they can provide valuable escapism they can be incredibly rich fodder for the imagination and I suspect Harry Potter is for many children But I don t call it literature and I myself don t like it Note the three star rating is because honestly when I first read it I did love it more"

"76","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"," Jul 26 2007"," J G Keely","it was ok"," Fairly standard kid s fantasy fare from Rowling as she re-introduces the world to the classic British fairy tale which had been mostly forgotten since Tolkien spliced it with the epic She mines gold from this rich and storied tradition but doesn t really fashion anything unique from it We can see the beginnings of Rowling s authorial failings and a hint of her strengths as well She adopts Rouald Dahl s awful family trope though it s clear that Rowling does not have the gift of bizarre characterization or the knowledge of the darker parts of the human soul that made his books resonate She writes sympathetic characters but not unusual ones Overall her writing has relatively little character or style Then again mass success often requires leaving the more unusual elements behind So she relies on standard character types managing to keep them afloat through the patented perpetual plot of the airplane book She also pulls from that old British tradition of children lost in fairyland seen often in early fantasy Dunsany Eddison which Lewis also made use of She also has the vast unknown underground of magic just beneath our world which keeps itself always mysterious and quiet much favored by Gaiman and other Urban Fantasy authors though Rowling s invented world is strained and piecemeal moreso as the series goes on The strength of the book is that it combines the tradition of the child in fairyland with another British standby the boarding school bildungsroman It s the same neat trick Mervyn Peake pulled in Gormenghast though Rowling s version is tame in comparison Her tale of the intellectual emotional and physical growth of the young outcast everyman is rather predictable except for some insight into angst in the fifth book Rowling s prose is quick and simple but sometimes awkward and without music or joy It is not the sort of deliberate simplicity Carroll achieved by expressing complex ideas in playful terms It is rather the sign of an author whose unsophisticated voice prevents her language from vaulting higher Simplistic elegance is deceptively difficult to achieve and so it s hard to blame Rowling too much when she falters It s unfortunate that she didn t put a few failed books under her belt before finding success as such early outings are often best winnowed chaff Her plotting--as ever--is scattered and convenient though in a shorter book it shows less Her plot twists as usual disappoint they are not built upon progression of events but upon reader expectation and emotional red herrings It s the beginning of an enjoyable series but there s really no need to start any earlier than the third book when Rowling finally finds her pace and begins to lean more heavily on that which she does well which helps to hide her faults Watch the movie if you need a primer My Fantasy Book Suggestions more"

"82","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"," Aug 12 2016"," Luke Taylor","it was amazing"," So what is Harry Potter and The Philosopher s Stone Good question But first I ask you what is magic To me magic is the captivating voice of the imagination transmutable and quantifiable it finds its verve in the proper arrangement of words These words can make you laugh and cry and dream dreams that will never die It would go without saying that Jo Rowling changed the world when she created Harry Potter and the result is a deeply meaningful and shareable universe as vast and grand as Star Wars Final Fantasy and enrapturing works that have continued to span generations with the perfect combination of action creativity and character As this is my very first reading of Harry Potter and I have never seen the movies though some things have been spoiled but not many I was so happy to treat myself with the release of Vault of Dreams to the UK Bloomsbury 2010 set that comes in a wonderful red box and I have two lovely friends to thank for this Chelsea Slytherpuff and Chenda Slytherin because without their friendship and enthusiasm this vast landscape of literary gold would still be void in my life Whilst Potter is undeniably English its likability constitutes some of the very best qualities of Anglophilia like Christmas pudding and the Hogwarts Express and reminds us that the stone set in the silver sea has not only some of the greatest writers male and female the world has ever seen but continues to capture our lust for fantastical adventure as a place so heavily steeped in magic mystery and muggle-dom that Potter s inherent Englishness makes it overly charming and utterly adorable and for me tearfully nostalgic The very definition of timeless not only for its colorful cast of characters a true ensemble series this is With someone for everyone to love or hate or its prose lighter than C S Lewis Narnia but just as enchanting or its cleverness and conceptualization Harry Potter finds the precious space in our hearts that we ve all been endowed the perfect space to live and dream and desire to be great to know that destiny is a powerful force at work in our lives but life is still and adventure full of choices and the key to truly living is truly the most unexplainably magical idea there is was and ever will be and that is love Recommended for everyone And get that beautiful red box set whilst you re at it The covers are 3 more"

"100","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"," May 01 2009"," Tatiana","really liked it"," I primarily wanted to reread this book in honor of the Banned Books Week this series is 1 on the Top 100 Banned Challenged Books 2000-2009 list It also happened that I was on vacation in Orlando and surely enough a Universal Studios Hogwarts visit was a must Oh the nostalgia A lot has been said already about the series so I won t repeat I just feel very very sad for the kids whose parents choose to ban these books from their houses and their lives To take something so wondrous imaginative so magical from children is pretty much a crime in my eyes These books have given me a lot pleasure over the years but I have to praise them especially for their ability to turn the old me and my equally old husband into children who can still sigh in delight at seeing Hogwarts the Sorting Hat the Olivander s almost come to life and smile from ear to ear just because we were drinking butterbeer at Three Broomsticks it s very tasty BTW I ve been there and flown on a broomstick with Harry Potter more"

"103","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"," Dec 01 2011"," Stepheny","it was amazing"," I was in eighth grade when my mom brought me home a paperback copy of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone I immediately gave her the most outraged look possible and couldn t believe that she would be handing me something as ridiculous as Harry Potter But Mom I said I read Stephen King This book is for kids Well if there is one thing my mom knows it is her children So she said back to me Stepheny they are talking about banning this book from the schools Well that was all it took She knew me well enough and knew my feelings on book-banning I waited until she walked out of the room before cautiously picking the book up not wanting to give her the satisfaction of knowing she hit the right button I skimmed the back cover and had an internal conflict as to whether or not I was actually going to read Harry Potter Sure people were talking about this book everywhere but come on it s a children s book After a few minutes of going back and forth inside my own head I decided I would at the very least give it a shot I mean why not right I told myself that if I didn t like it I could put it down and move on with my life I finished that book that same day I picked it up became so immersed that I couldn t put it down and it was over before I knew what had just happened Later that evening I asked my mom if she could pick me up the other 2 books of the series that were already out When she gave me the next two I finished those and had to wait for a whole year before I could get my hands on the fourth one I was hooked There is a reason that I encourage people to read this series It is life-changing For me anyway I would re-read the first books before the new one was coming out would wait in the endless lines at midnight to get my copy and stay up the rest of the night reading until my eyes forced themselves shut against my insistence that they stay open I am a part of the Harry Potter generation even if I got a late start I have continued the tradition of re-reading the series every year and I am telling you- it never gets old In fact it makes me feel young again It takes me back to my young carefree days when life was easy and made sense I read this series because I love every word of it The characters are unforgettable the storyline is an adventure and the series itself is perfection This book has seen me through my worst days It saw me through my awkward teenage years my insecure post-high school years and the uncomfortable years where you are trying to define who you are and where you stand in the world And when my father was first diagnosed with cancer I turned to this book to help me out It has never once let me down I tell people to read the first few books to get a feel for the story but know they are definitely children s books That by no means lowers the level of enjoyment But as the story progresses the storyline matures as do the characters I see a piece of myself in nearly every character and I think that is what helps make Harry Potter such an incredible experience Even if the situations are a little extreme you can relate to the characters The world is so real you just know it actually exists and that JKR has been granted access-which is why she was able to write about it- DUH I am thankful I was able to convince my GR buddy Delee to pick these books up and even more thrilled that she loved it So far every person I have persuaded has enjoyed the books and that is an incredible feat- if not only for the reason that every person I have persuaded has had very different tastes in books These books are truly something special With as many times as I have read these books this is the first time I have tried to write a review How do you even write a review for HP I guess I can sum it up with this I will continue to re-read these books until I am dead and hope to one day share it with the children I don t have yet This is more than just a book-it is a part of who I am more"

"109","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"," Jun 30 2015"," Alex Farrand","really liked it"," Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is about a seemingly normal young orphan boy named Harry Potter He lives with his way too ordinary and boring aunt and uncle who abuses him The thing is Harry is not ordinary but famous in a entirely different and hidden world Harry is a wizard We follow Harry on a new exciting adventure through the wizarding world while he attends his first year at the most prestigious school Hogwarts One day I decided that I would read to my two-year-old daughter the Harry Potter series because I was tired of reading her beginner books I was hoping she would listen and become excited about the series but again she is two and I don t think she paid much attention She just wanted me to be distracted so she could play more Well I hope she listened somewhat She did ask to read Harry Potter so score It is a start Eventually trying to keep her attention I decided to buy the illustrated version of the Sorcerer s Stone but I only had two chapters left So I won t review the illustrated version but I will show some impressive pictures The Sorcerer s Stone is written for a younger child and the whole series grows up with the reader The Sorcerer s Stone is the brightest and happiest book with a lot of action to keep young minds attention It is an easy read and entertaining This is really my third time reading this novel As a kid I never read the series I wasn t big into reading I was too cool being a sport s athlete he he Dust my shoulder off I am kidding I never was cool In my 20s I read this book for the first time and honestly I wasn t too hot for it The second time around I thought it was better Secretly I haven t finished the series I am going to read The Half Blood Prince soon I plan to finish the series this year I feel ashamed to say it but I am not very good at keeping up with a series Reading this to my daughter the third time around I caught and noticed more things I am glad I restarted the series and I am glad to be sharing this piece of work with my daughter The most fascinating aspect about the book is the magical world that Rowling created When Harry first enters Diagon Alley it always takes my breath away Truly it is magical and a beautiful sight It brings that inner child out of me the little girl with extremely curly hair who pretended to have superpowers or fought off demons I get lost in her world and I am enchanted by the magic That one little girl walks through the shops buys her first wand learns her lessons and chants her spells She has no adult cares and she is happy that her dream world is real even though it is in her imagination I am hoping at 27 years-old that this magical world exist Maybe my daughter will be accepted I like the mystery behind Harry Potter There are so many questions to think of and one question leads to another I watched the movies so I know what is going to happen but here I am still trying to solve the puzzle I always love a bit of mystery to keep me guessing I love having information at the tips of my fingers Being on the sixth book I spotted more intertwining of the series and I am a big fan of it I love the little clues left about certain characters or places I am sure I still missed some because reading at a snail pace is really hard to do Lastly I adore Snape He is my favorite character because he is mysterious dark and he leans on the fence between good and evil I want to know more about him and any background information makes me giddy Plus Alan Rickman is an amazing actor and he did a wonderful job at playing Snape My second favorite is Professor McGonagall because she is just a bad ass noble takes no sass strong female character She amuses me With all that being said I still cannot relate to our trio I guess the closest I come to is Heromine because I could be the overachiever They are nosey little kids I guess the hat wouldn t place me in Gryffindor Don t worry I still love them It wouldn t be a great book if they just told adults the facts Now the illustrated version is a beautiful amazing work of art I almost cried when it was delivered to me Just look for yourself The pages were nice and thick It even came with an attached bookmark The only problem I had were the pages had a gloss coat which created a glare Sometimes it was hard to read This print is expensive but it was totally worth the money I am a fan I have the illustrated version of The Chamber of Secrets and my daughter wants to read it because the cover has a car on it We are onto the next book Read it and tell me what you think "

"113","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"," Feb 18 2011"," Brigid Cool Ninja Sharpshooter","it was amazing"," So a bunch of my Goodreads friends are doing a Harry Potter re-read challenge And since I haven t read these in like five years and I ve only read them once gasp I am joining in on the fun Finished re-reading this one yesterday and I enjoyed it far more than the first two times I read it Some background I read the first two books when I was 9 and then gave up and then I didn t read the entire series until I was 18 The last time I read this series I went into it being a bit cynical to be honest People had been telling me to read them for years and I resisted forever because I thought I was a cool non-conformist I don t really know But anyway this time around I m just letting myself enjoy these books like a normal person And I really enjoyed my re-read of this book It s a lot of fun it s absorbing it has terrific and original world-building and it has a great cast of characters Also now that I ve actually read the whole series I was amazed at how many allusions there are to the following books I know J K Rowling did a lot of careful planning and it shows Really looking forward to re-reading the rest of the books Old review under the cut -------- view spoiler Old review 2 28 11 Okay so funny story I started to read these books back in third grade when they were first becoming like THE BIG THING I read the first two and a half and then gave up for one reason or another I got bored I guess Eh don t remember And then I just never got around to reading them and everyone was constantly talking about them and bugging me to read them like POKE POKE BRIGID READ HARRY POTTER So I was like Yeah I m not going to because I m a nonconformist And basically the whole thing just became really annoying because the more people told me to read them the more I didn t want to If that makes sense Well finally my sisters gave into the whole craze and became obsessed just like everyone else And so with all my friends and two little sisters constantly nagging me I caved Plus my sisters bought them all so they were already sitting there on my bookshelf I guess it s a bit hard to judge since now I m 18 and ya know not really a little kid anymore Although yeah I know the books get more mature which is why I ll keep reading Over all it was enjoyable But I guess I see why at age 9 I didn t feel compelled to keep reading There were a few things that irked me a First of all the whole story seemed to go by much too fast I guess you know it s for kids and all But still quite a lot of things happened with no down-time in between Events would just happen in two or three pages and then it d be on to the next thing straightaway Even the climax was only like ten pages long And after that it ended quite abruptly However in Rowling s defense I understand that this was her first book and so agents publishers probably pressured her to cut out as much as possible I m trying to get my first book published at the moment and so far quite a few agents have suggested that I cut about 70 000 words out of my manuscript So I know how it is O ob The writing Well for the most part it was all right But so many dialogue tags with adverbs One of my greatest pet peeves she exclaimed indignantly Although once again it s a kids book So I guess I shouldn t expect the writing style to be mind-blowingly awesome Also I ve been told five billion times that Rowling s writing style improves as the books progress so YAY c The characters are all very likable except Harry Potter himself I don t know what it is but I didn t feel much of an attachment to him Maybe it was because everyone is always fawning over him Like wherever he goes everyone s like OOOH IT S THE AWESOMETASTICAL HARRY POTTER Maybe I m just jealous Haha And he didn t have much of like an attitude at least not in this book Eh I assume he ll develop more later on As for what I liked As I mentioned already good characters Also it s a very creative story Rowling s world-building is very detailed which adds more to the suspension of disbelief and whatnot So that s pretty cool I can tell that she was setting up for a lot of future character relationships plot-lines etc And it s good to see a series that has actually been planned out in advance that s what a series is supposed to be like So many authors seem to just pull sequels out of their butts these days So yeah I guess that is all my thoughts on book n mero uno On to the next hide spoiler more"

"168","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"," Sep 20 2017"," ChopinFC","it was amazing"," Full review 5 Stars This is the easiest 5 stars I ve given a book Harry Potter and The Sorcerer s Stone combines a magical and mystical story full of enchantment a group of inseparable friends the amazing world of Hogwarts and an evil and omnipotent villain in Voldemort I know it s been a long time coming but I finally could no longer put off reading the magical world that J K Rowling have created out of pure love It s peculiar how marsterpieces are created They are usually born out of a combination of hard work determination part genius and lots of luck One can never force and will himself herself to create a master literary work or a musical piece that will last generations to come Beethoven wrote his most poignant work in his 9th and last Symphony when he was nearly deaf and destitute An example in sports Michael Jordan was told by multiple coaches he could never be great he was even cut from his high school basketball Varsity team Six NBA championships later he is perhaps the greatest basketball player who s ever lived The list of examples just goes on The literary masterpiece created by JK Rowling was certainly done against all odds Based on multiple interviews before reaching stratospheric fame Joanne Rowling had the idea of Harry Potter during a train ride At the time just like divine intervention she promptly started writing her ideas on a napkin so as not to forget any details In reality she was broke and needing government assistance She was a single mother with little to no income and would go to coffee shops and take her infant child while writing for hours on pen and paper After completing the first draft of HPSS she was rejected by multiple publishers They would say her work was very childish and had a limited audience If only they d know Harry Potter and the beloved series are universally loved because of so many things J K Rowling did right Harry Potter is predominantly the reason why the story works so well Apart from being an orphan he s not jaded and angry at the world His humble nature is an inspiration and a magnet to other good-hearted kids around him He ends up living with relatives who are jealous of him and despise him yet he s still well humored and kind to others His ascension during his magic training is impressive yet he remains grounded and friendly to his peers He s brave and somewhat impulsive but those traits are quite endearing as he often acts on a whim to save his friends and protect the ones he loves J K Rowling does a wonderful job in character building and description Even before the movies came out Potter s boyish looks ruffled hair and half-moon glasses were literally engraved in people s mind J K Rowling s ability to tell a simple yet magical fable make this such a timeless masterpiece Hogwarts School of Witchcraft is an awesome part of the Potter s world Every detailed description of a castle like University From the Great hall where the entire student body eats in long big wooden tables and the ceiling would open up to the heavens the way Hogwarts is subdivided into 4 different houses and each student is selected by a magical sorting hat Every tiny detail reminds us that Potter and his friends are attending a magic school where wizards are born and legends will thrive Other honorable mentions include the amazing magic system and different classes where students learn different magic spells transfiguration broom-flying lessons and so much more Needless to say the supporting cast in Potter s world is an essential ingredient to the HP formula Harry s friendship with Hermione and Ron his admiration for headmaster Dumbledore and his mistrust for professor Snape all make this a very organic and dynamic read The more I kept reading the more I wanted to immerse myself in the world of Harry Potter The story flows very naturally and the progression of Harry s life as an orphaned child to him becoming a famous wizard is addictive and entertaining The writing is rather simple JK Rowling does not impress with difficult or lyrical prose Yet at the same time she s just as effective with very vivid description of characters ghosts trolls and the evil Voldemort I d be remiss if I forgot to mention how AMAZING THE ILLUSTRATED EDITION OF HARRY POTTER BOOK IS The Illustrations are made by Jim Kay and were personally selected by Rowling herself In the kindle in motion edition the Illustrations actually move organically giving the story a Magical feeling Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is nothing short of wizardry tale masterclass It sets up the background for an entire narrative of books that are pure literary magic It s also appropriate for kids from 8 to 80 years old 5 STARS more"

"197","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"," Mar 13 2010"," Becky","it was amazing"," I wasn t sure if I was going to write a review of these books but I try to write a review of all of the books that I read and it s been kind of nagging at me that I didn t write one for this It s hard to write a review for a book that is so dang popular and well known What is there to say that s new I dunno I think pretty much everything s been said but still I wanted to write a review for this and to talk about these books even if I m just rehashing everything that s already been done I remember when these first came out I never really wanted to read them I thought of them as kid s books and even though I read YA my overly-critical half just kept saying that these weren t for me I don t know if it was the cover or the insta-popularity of the books or what but I didn t read them I avoided them like the plague Until a friend of mine was reading the 5th book and was so engrossed in it that he would do the yes yes I m paying attention nod while his eyes remained glued to the page And as a reader myself I know that look So I asked to borrow the book he was reading and he refused He told me that if I was going to read it I d have to READ it starting with the first book So the next day he lent me the first and second books both of which I finished in record time and then I understood And I never looked back There s something about these books that is just magical Yeah yeah cliche I know But it s true Yes they are about magic but they are about so much more than that They are about love and friendship and loyalty and trust and betrayal and commitment and all the things that we aspire to have and to be as humans They are about understanding and forgiveness and learning who we are when it really matters And all of these things are buried in this shell of fun and adventure and mystery that makes them irresistible I decided to read these again in the original UK editions because I know that the US editions were Americanized and I wanted to re-experience them in their true form I dislike when things are changed from their original format I hate abridgments and condensed versions etc I want to experience the story how the author wrote it how it was meant to be experienced without some guy in a suit somewhere trying to make it accessible to me I like the feeling that I get of learning something of another culture through the words they use and the meaning that they give the words This is why they taught us reading comprehension in third grade so that we can read and LEARN Learning doesn t have to be boring and tedious it can be fun if we allow it to be But it seems that we ve lost that ability Sad Anyway I re-read the first book now appropriately titled Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone and I was surprised at how emotional I felt reading it especially after knowing where it all ends It was like seeing friends that you ve missed for years again and while it makes you happy to see them it s also sad because you know they ll have to go again too soon That s how I felt like I was seeing friends and that my time with them is short That s kind of a silly way to feel because they are forever and I can visit anytime I want to but I felt that way anyway Especially meeting Ron again He s my favorite character for an absolute reason which is because he is so loyal and funny and true and he gives his whole heart when he gives it at all I wish that there were more people like Ron I can t wait to re-read the rest of the series and see if this feeling remains I love discovering the hidden gems that Rowling has left for us to find in mythology and history and legend and word-play and in life Who wouldn t love these books more"

"201","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"," Oct 27 2017"," Lynx","it was amazing"," Growing up in the era I did you couldn t get away from Harry Potter In the bookstores school yards and big screens it was Potter mania It was so over saturated that I grew to hate Harry Potter even though I had never picked up a book or seen the film My friends would blabber away about their love as I voiced my hated back to them just as passionately One friend in particular would never let it go You love books How can you not even give it a go NEVER my stubborn self would protest One day she came over to my house to hangout and after she d left I found the first 4 Potter books sitting on my bed She knew my inner book nerd would come out and that I d have to open them I was furious but figured if I read the first chapter or two I could tell her I gave it a go and finally get her off my back Of course one chapter turned into 5 then 10 until suddenly it was morning and I d read the whole thing I spent the next 3 days reading the rest of them By the time I saw her again I was a full blown Potterhead That was almost 20 years ago I thought it might be fun to reread this one as an adult and see if my perceptions have changed They haven t It was still just as magical as it was that night I first entered Hogwarts Rowling created such a wonderful world and filled it with characters who become your friends It s been awhile but I m so glad I visited them again and cannot wait to move on to the Chamber of Secrets more"

"205","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"," Dec 28 2016"," Chelsea","it was amazing"," review also posted on Wordpress It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live Though this was not the first time I read Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone it was the first time I read the illustrated edition While the illustrations are gorgeous and I d recommend everyone to get this edition I don t think it changed my reading experience To be honest though I already knew all the drawings due to my photos on Bookstagram so it might be different for Chamber of Secrets because I haven t glanced through that one yet Either way I have no idea how I am going to survive the sequel there were tons of drawings of spiders in Philosopher s Stone Chamber of Secrets is only going to get worse As much as I love the Harry Potter series I have many issues with J K Rowling That s no secret In this book there were also a couple of things that bothered me First of she is clearly fat-phobic She needs to stop calling fat people pigs Even though Dudley and Vernon are unlikeable does not mean they should be made fun of due to their weight Some people might call her a feminist icon but I very much disagree She supports casting Johnny Depp even though he abused his wife Her misogyny becomes more clear in the later books but there was also some in this one already When Draco and Harry are flying on their brooms there were screams and gasps from girls Some of you might not think that is sexist but I hate the fact that she felt the need to add from girls to that sentence As if the boys weren t scared or interested in what was happening As for the writing I kind of dislike the way Hagrid s lines are written If someone has an accent I d rather have that the author wrote x said in an accent or something like that Now I will get into spoilers foreshadowing questions I have So this part contains spoilers for the rest of the series You ve been warned Ted the newsreader on the Muggle news grins when they are talking about the many owl sightings I think that might be Ted Tonks He was a muggle-born wizard so it makes sense Sirius let Hagrid borrow his bike How can there only be one wizarding bank That doesn t make any sense Hagrid isn t allowed to do magic because he was expelled Yet he knows how to do nonverbal spells There is rumoured to be a dragon in Gringotts Why do the students have to buy their robes beforehand when they don t know their houses yet James wand was excellent for transfiguration Molly asks what platform number they have to go to It is always platform 9 3 4 She went to Hogwarts herself and takes her children there every year so how could she not know that Almost everyone of Harry s generation is sorted in the same house as their parents Children do not always have the same traits as their parents so that s unfortunate Harry has the following dream He was wearing Professor Quirrell s turban which kept talking to him telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once because it was his destiny Harry told the turban he didn t want to be in Slytherin it got heavier and heavier he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully -- and there was Malfoy laughing at him as he struggled with it -then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher Snape whose laugh became high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and Harry woke sweating and shaking I guess that this dream is foreshadowing for what s to come Obviously Quirrel s turban is Voldemort who talks to him at the end of the book In Chamber of Secrets Harry questions whether he doesn t belong in Slytherin instead Malfoy was supposed to kill Dumbledore in Half-blood Prince but it was Snape who finished the job instead hence the burst of green light Snape urged Quirrell to stay loyal to Hogwarts Therefore Voldemort should know that Snape s true loyalties lie with Dumbledore and not him McGonagall says it s the first time four students were out of bed in one night Okay sure Minerva We all know that s not true She also says they shouldn t be walking around at night especially these days What is she referring to The centaurs are angry when Firenze interfered when Quirrell Voldemort was going to attack Harry Firenze says he hopes the planets have been read wrongly So the centaurs know Voldemort is going to kill Harry they just didn t know when exactly Peeves says wee student beasty I wonder whether he is referring to the Marauders Dumbledore says that Voldemort is not truly alive and therefore cannot be killed Did he know about the horcruxes already conclusion As usual I enjoyed reading this tremendously I love the amount of foreshadowing and look forward to re-reading the rest of the series again more"

"216","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"," May 29 2017"," Trish","it was amazing"," This year marks the 20th anniversary of the very first Harry Potter book so special editions have been released and of course I pre-ordered them months ago The story is the original one that we all know about No amendments there which is largely due to the fact that we experience stuff from Harry s POV so we only get to see certain common rooms at certain moments in the story Therefore I d like to conentrate on the extra content in each version as well as the GORGEOUS illustrations Every book has the respective house crest with the three characteristics in the beginning followed by the individual chapters in this case - Hufflepuff An Introduction- Making Hufflepuff Proud- House Founder Helga Hufflepuff- House Relic- House Livery- House GhostThen comes the actual story followed by - The Sorting- Hogwarts Quiz- House Common Room- Memorable Hufflepuff Students- Famous Hufflepuff Alumni- Head of Hufflepuff House- The House Cup- J K Rowling Twenty Years of MagicMoreover each book also has a pretty map of Hogwarts and its grounds Throughout the book there are various illustrations unique to the respective house of the house ghost founder or head of house etc by Levi Pinfold which is really giving this an extra edge just like the sprayed edges that are like the house livery The crests on the dust jackets are especially nice because of the contrast which is why I decided t get the hardcovers and not the paperbacks It s a little bit of a cheat since I didn t re-read the entire book especially not 4 times but concentrated on the extra content and illustration but although I knew the extra content from the early days of Pottermore I still enjoyed this very much more"
"217","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"," Feb 03 2018"," John King","it was amazing"," I want to first discuss about the author J K Rowling before proceeding with the book Overall she is an author I highly respect due to the originality she employs in this book as well as the future books On top of that she uses classic narrative devices which is not too common in magical fantasy books and she delivers a complex yet magical plot which contributes to an entertaining thriller In general this book is quite hard to put down The magical plot characters concepts such as the four houses of Hogwarts among other elements enhance the reading experience greatly In fact you can sense some inventive forms of wittiness in the writing and perhaps Rowling herself Since this is a magical fantasy book humor plays a huge role This is a story full of surprises and jokes that will allow you to better absorb the darker elements to the story Those darker elements prove to be necessary since they are what makes the characters and perhaps the story more relatable Ultimately J K Rowling does a wonderful job with this book in the sense of inspiring and entertaining a wide audience ranging from children to adults and it is all due to her inventive imagination and originality more"

whatever you want to call him Let me say it again HARRY POTTER IS A SUE No wonder it was boring and bothering me so much I can hear you future readers at present I have exactly none demanding to know why just why I think he is a Sue and how dare I Those of you who haven t fainted that is puts on mafia boss accent You wanna know why Let me count the ways If you could just keep track on your fingers oh it looks like you ll need your toes as well that would be really helpful Right Here we go 1 He s hated by all the nasty some of them ridiculously evil people 2 And liked by all the good ones 3 He has a cool scar black hair and green eyes Like yeah He looks cool This is the reason I stay away from the black hair green eyes combo in my own writing it s really something that gets doled out by most authors to their specialest favouritest characters And boy is Harry Potter special or what 4 He s famous Not only that but everyone bows to him in the street I think we just discovered Buddha s successor 5 He s rich Insanely rich What are the odds 6 He got into the best school for magic around Without even applying 7 He s a Gryffindor the most fantabulous house in the school 8 He s fantastic at broomsticking even though he s never had any practice whatsoever 9 Immediately instead of getting punished for breaking the rules he gets put on the Quidditch team even though it s unheard of for someone so young to be there And this is after the teacher sees one single display of catching a Remembrall Ever heard of beginners luck Adrenaline-fuelled ability perhaps Heightened senses With all this she still decides that Harry should be in the Quidditch team 10 Continuing the theme of complete and utter Sueness FREE BROOMSTICK Not only that it s the latest in broomstick technology 11 He got given his broomstick by a teacher I will leave you to guess the phrase that applies here Starts with t and ends with eacher s pet Wow You got it Tell me have you applied for Mensa yet 12 He then impresses everybody on the Quidditch team with his special specialness to such an extent that he s likened to the greatest Quidditch player in a hundred years who was also definitely older than Harry when he played Quidditch 13 Invisible cloak He s got all this and then to add to it he gets an invisible cloak 14 He s smart 15 He s brave 16 He s good at magic These last three combined are a Sueness Overload in themselves 17 And yet even with all these qualities he s so generous and brave is purported to have such good judgement etc that you feel as if the urge to like him is being shoved down your throat stirred until properly combined and left to set for three hours 18 This is the part that made me almost throw up Hermione for no good reason throws her arms around Harry and tells him how great he is and that she s basically not worth half of what he is Just stuff some more Sueness down our throats why don t you J 19 Harry just escaped major Sue-ity again because Neville Longbottom s final points are the ones that win Gryffindor the House Cup Trophy thing Still Ron and Hermione win a generic fifty points each Harry of course has to get sixty Minor Sue-ness 20 Yeah he loses Gryffindor a massive 150 points but he gets it all back doesn t he Being treated like an outcast doesn t really seem to have made an impression on him at all 21 Instead of being punished for heading into the third-floor corridor he is rewarded Now make no mistake I do see that there are times when we should break the rules for the right reasons But surely to maintain order shouldn t the perpetrators be punished on the surface of things Surely Harry should be given grunt work or detention or something right Wrong 22 The way he was saved from the evil Lord Voldemort is by nothing other than Pure Love cue sparkles 23 Dumbledore turns out to have given Harry the cloak Surely having been a teacher for many years he would recognise what mischief kids get up to and would really NOT want a boy whose friends include the brother of Fred and George Weasley to have access to an invisible cloak Or if it comes to that any kid at all T-E-A-C-H-E-R-S-P-E-T I wouldn t care if HP only displayed a couple of these characteristics but he s got the whole lot The thing that really drives me up the wall is that surely this should be the ultimate guide for what not to do when writing a book and yet and yet it s a bestseller It s not sour grapes that keep me writing this post It s sheer confuzzled amazement The writing style is boring and forgettable No description to speak of no real thoughts There are some allusions to historical figures and terms and so on but they aren t presented in an interesting way And couldn t we have at least met Nicholas Flamel The morals in Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone are negligible at best It s just me me me propaganda in disguise one lying sneaking and even immobilising episode after another And that s from the so-called good characters Clich after clich abounds in this book It s there in Dumbledore s white beard It s there in Harry s surprisingly quick Quidditch triumph It s there in Professor Quirrel s turban And most of all it s there in Draco Malfoy a character so flat he could ve been made out of paper and then run over with a steamroller and his original shape would have been slightly rounder Added to which the plot is so unoriginal Can anyone say Cinderella Orphaned child mysteriously left with a mean boring family who doesn t want him and treats him terribly Discovers that he really belongs to a world beyond his wildest dreams And that he s very very rich Almost immediately he s at home there Sure he has his enemies but who doesn t And they get dealt with anyway Added to which it turns out that his parents are super-cool If that s original then I m Neville Longbottom s true love Turns out everybody who keeps calling this original is Neville s honeybunchkins I had to struggle to finish this book Really struggle I had it out from the library for nine weeks because I kept putting it down for ten days or so then realizing I should probably finish it to see if it got better I d pick it up and realise that I d forgotten what had happened before meaning I had to go back to the beginning and start all over again This as you may well imagine drove me nuts Eventually with the help of SparkNotes I managed to figure it out and I ve just taken book 2 out of the library I m wondering if it gets any better After all J K Rowling s run out of Cinderella storyline Considering how much people love this series to me at this point in time they are inexplicably popular I m not going to end with a pessimistic I don t think so I might go with something more like this It s got to right Right -------- Disclaimer As I am not at this point in time a Harry Potter fan I ve probably gotten a couple of things wrong although I ve checked and double-checked to the best of my ability If you see any errors please comment and let me know However even if a few things are a bit off there are still about twenty points on this list Surely that s enough to merit consideration anyway more"

"227","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"," Feb 15 2014"," Sharon","it was amazing"," I found the idea of this series of books wonderful When they were released there were not a lot of children s books that were set in the world of magic I think for me the greatest thing about this book is it teaches children and adults alike that you can achieve anything you wish even when you think that it is impossible I also think the theme of friendship is important people can be friends whether you agree with everything about them or not Hermione is a great example of that throughout the book she is more of a straight-laced student but she befriends Ron and Harry She tells them it is to keep them out of trouble but I believe deep down she is actually happy that she has found people that like a bit of adventure it is something new to her One aspect of the story that there has been a lot of discussion about is why Harry was left with the Dursley s after the death of his parents Although it is clear that Harry is not treated very well at all I think this was the best place for Harry to grow up Although he cannot understand why they do not like him because of his magical ability they teach Harry a very valuable lesson kindness when he comes across all different kinds of people at Hogwarts he is more prone to showing kindness to them after the way he has been treated by the Dursley s They also have taught him how to stand up for himself when he is taunted by Draco Malfoy Rowling has the ability to create the world that every reader of these books wishes to enter and never leave With owls that deliver the mail a magical school where anything is possible and let s not forget the moving pictures Hogwarts is a place that will live in the hearts of fans for years to come All and all a great start to what looks like a fantastic series If you are a fan of all things magical and have not delved into the world of Harry Potter yet I would highly recommend you give this series a chance more"

"245","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"," Oct 24 2011"," Olivia McCloskey","it was amazing"," Happiness can be found in the darkest of times if only one remembers to turn on the light Since 1997 the Harry Potter series has enchanted readers both young and old Legendary British author J K Rowling s debut novel has gained international acclaim since its initial publication winning a total of seven awards Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is the thrilling first installment of the series where all of the magic began The novel begins at the small quiet house on Number Four Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey where the book s eleven year-old protagonist Harry Potter lives in the cupboard under the stairs He was orphaned at a young age after his parents were killed in a tragic accident and was sent to live with the Dursleys Aunt Petunia Uncle Vernon and their son Dudley His only living relatives treat him poorly making Harry s childhood miserable Harry s unhappy demeanor is replaced by one of elation when he receives a letter inviting him to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry the finest school for witches and wizards in all of Britain As the novel unfolds Harry begins his first year at Hogwarts where he is introduced to the wizarding world befriends other students and comes face-to-face with adversity The twists and turns mounting suspense and thrilling perils that Harry encounters render this book life-changning and unforgettable Rowling has a rare talent for creating believable realistic characters that gradually change as the story progresses These characters as some people would say possess a certain amount of depth Their unique personalities and traits distinguish them from the characters in similar novels Harry embodies all of the characteristics of a true hero courage tenacity and an inclination to protect others Harry is willing to sacrifice everything including his own life to ensure the safety of others Rowling accurately captures his desire to protect those he loves whatever the cost I must admit Rowling s imagination is extraordinary Her original vision of a young boy sporting a lighting scar who attended boarding school was transformed into a seven book series teeming with the unimaginable Rowling s creative prowess enabled her to establish an entirely new world filled with realistic people magical creatures and thrilling enchantments The wizarding world was crafted so thoroughly that it is flawless No minor detail of this alternate world was excluded allowing readers to fully immerse themselves in the book As the plot unfolded readers received a glimpse of the growing complexity of the series Rowling introduced specific details throughout the novel which the majority of readers overlook These seemingly insignificant details however have a large impact upon later events within the book My predictions of the events to come were quite far from the actual events that transpired The shocking conclusion left me stunned and begging my mother to drive me to Barnes and Noble to purchase the second book While Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone falls under the Fantasy genre Rowling discretely incorporated many mythological and historical references into the novel especially those pertaining to the works of Ancient Rome First and foremost among these allusions is Hagrid s three-headed dog Fluffy The concept of such a creature is taken from Greek Mythology according to legend Cerberus a three-headed dog ferociously guarded the entrance to the Underworld The only means of subduing Cerberus and Fluffy consequently is the playing of a lyre Additionally the Hogwarts motto Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus is Latin for Never tickle a sleeping dragon Rowling relies heavily on her knowledge of Latin to create incantations and character names throughout the series I am most impressed not with the books themselves but with the author whose rags-to-riches life story has inspired countless people worldwide J K Rowling was born Joanne Kathleen Rowling into a poor family living in Gloucestershire England She was accepted at the University of Exeter where she studied Classics She was devastated when her mother died shortly after her graduation having suffered from multiple sclerosis Several years later Rowling married Jorge Arantes and gave birth to their daughter Jessica The unhappy couple separated 13 months after their marriage Homeless penniless and caring for a newborn Rowling struggled with depression and contemplated suicide We almost lost the brilliant talented mind who is solely responsible for the series that has now become a worldwide phenomenon Her rags to riches story inspires millions of people in similar situations Despite her challenges Rowling s perseverance and determination brought the world of Harry Potter to life Overall this series is the most memorable from my childhood I was originally introduced to the series in third grade and immediately fell in love with the realistic characters suspenseful plot and flawless writing style I was the diehard fan who watched each movie a dozen times at the same movie theater eventually coming to know the employees at the concessions stand on a first name basis For Halloween last year in fact I dressed up in an old pair of robes pulled on a wig and drew a scar on my forehead And to this day I find myself reciting quotes from the series I was crushed after the release of the final book feeling that part of my childhood had ended with the series Looking back I have never once regretted the time I have spent reading and rereading the series committing it to memory The Harry Potter series has served as more than a way to pass the time it has helped to shape the person I am today more"

"248","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"," Nov 28 2007"," Mariel","it was amazing"," I m not the usual Harry Potter fan I don t think To the well organized mind death is but the next great adventure - Albus Dumbledore I don t wanna die Who cares My favorite Dumbledore is Aberforth Y know the one who performed an experimental charm on goats and got sent to appear before the ministry for it Albus isn t even sure he can read for that matter I m more Aberforth on the wisdom scale fo sho I once asked JK Rowling what the charm was She said my guess was as good as hers She also laughed evilly I have my answer Wake up and smell the flowers Huh The goats are eating all the flowers and they sure smell experimental pretty It wasn t as fun after Order of the Phoenix and the bitching commenced Yeah there were problems But I m not organized I don t wanna die and I never really cared how it ended as much as I cared about focusing on the cool little stuff I got into the series after Prisoner of Azkaban came out and before Goblet of Fire So it wasn t the movies or that Daniel Radcliffe was -then- Elijah Wood before he was uglier What made me want to read them The Dursleys I thought they sounded wonderfully delicious they are hilarious I love it when Vernon tells everyone that Harry attends St Brutus Center for Incurably Criminal Boys His Japanese golfer joke When playing trivia games with friends I d piss myself with excitement if I got a muggle question Vernon s drill company is called Grunnings Yes I m more amazing than all of you put together Wonder why no one plays reindeer games with me anymore I love muggles I loved the stupid shit No not the mythology references Yaaay she read Shakespeare My Uncle Remus did too Not even that she listened to The Smiths and The Beatles while coming up with the series I do love that I loved the Aberforth goat stuff I loved the names of Lockhart s books Gadding with Ghouls Year with the Yeti etc and the little humor stuff she slips in I can still quote asshole-y things that Draco Malfoy taunted them with Potter stinks and can t remember the basic plot twists I was a card carrying Potterite laminated Sigh I do miss wondering what was going to happen next I miss having that place to retreat to in my mind I d go on my favorite Harry forum and have fun making up theories I was right about EVERYYTHING coughs I m jealous of JK Rowling for having that place in her mind Yeah I ve got my own stories But I don t think I have as much fun with mine probably because I m not a sadistic murderer like she is I liked the books better before they grew up Rowling couldn t write a love story for anything I hated it whenever Ron was mad at Harry My favorite Buffy seasons to watch when depressed are the first three because the core group are still together I love the togetherness Aberforth was eventually important in the last book That almost ruined it P s In case I didn t look dorky enough I used to get into rabid debates about the English to American changes with the transatlantic fans They were all like Americans are so dumb that you don t understand what Philosopher means I delivered eighteen shots to their stomach with my comebacks about Lee not being black in their versions JK Rowlings name being JK in the first place it doesn t mean Just Kidding The publishers thought boys wouldn t read a female author and their effing ugly covers English kids lose so often No Edward Gorey for Joan Aiken s books I did know that jumper meant sweater It s not just a Hayden Christensen vehicle more"
"249","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"," Mar 20 2010"," Trish","it was amazing"," My history with Harry Potter is a long and complex one Originally I refused to be part of the hype and read this book No idea how long it took the series to cross the channel and come to Germany but I never wanted anything to do with it However one Christmas there was nothing good on TV and the program showed the picture of a snowy owl my favourite animal so reluctantly but also finally slightly curious I switched on the TV and was ENCHANTED by Diagon Alley the atmosphere throughout and the insightful and funny story as well as the performance by all actors my favourite was McGonagall from the start Not long after I was asked to come see the 4th movie in theatre and I loved the Triwizard Tournament I watched the 5th movie in cinema as well but still did not own the books About a year later I even held a presentation in English Literature together with three others each of us was representing one house complete with the respective scarf Dobby and some Hogwarts banner for decoration and Harry s wand instead of a laser pointer for the power-point presentation on the screen It was only after that that I looked for the books online I never bought them because I never liked the normal editions but then I found this special edition of the hardcover which I bought immediately as well as the special hardcover edition of the second one the others followed shortly later Only then did I finally read the story for myself What struck me immediately upon reading this for the very first time was that Rowling always matched the age of Harry with the writing style we see everything through Harry s eyes easing into an entirely new world being just as amazed as he is and the writing style represents that from one book to the next there is a development in complexity that matches the development of the kids growing up At the same time however the story moves the reader so much because it doesn t shy away from addressing dark topics like child abuse and bullying The dialogues are witty and comical and core topics such as friendships and loyalty are present everywhere In principle those are standard ingredients for stories and yet Rowling manages to mix them together in such a unique way that is simply excuse the pun magical The way she makes the characters creatures and places come to life and transports the reader into the wizarding world is a master-stroke There are so many intricate details that make everything seem so utterly real and that show she had the entire world planned out from the beginning just waiting to tell the entire tale I always love coming back to this fantastic world taking classes at Hogwarts eating in the great hall solving mysteries even if it s life-threatening Yes I m a complete Potterhead and proud of it DFor anyone wondering I m a Gryffindor my wand is spruce with phoenix feather core 10 3 4 inches long unyielding my Patronus is a fox and in Ilvermorny I would have been in Horned Serpent So there you go more"
"250","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"," Nov 26 2014"," Maxwell","it was amazing"," Reread November 2014Obviously this isn t my first time reading Sorcerer s Stone I think this is the 3rd reading for me And as every time before I loved it immensely I really am just reminded of how incredible J K Rowling is at crafting a story a whole world and setting up the rest of the series while still writing a smart entertaining children s book Because in reality this first book is very young feeling but it s never dumbed down Since most people have read this or know the plot I thought I would instead share some fun thoughts I had or noticed upon rereading this book -What do you think the sorting hat said to Hermione Ron or any of the other characters when they tried it on -Dumbledore s Chocolate Frog card mentions his defeat of Grindewald a fact that doesn t come to be important until book 6 or 7 -The Weasley twins are hilarious as always and they know the secret passages already probably thanks to the Marauder s Map that shows up in book 3 -I wonder why Hermione wasn t in Ravenclaw I m sure there is some sort of answer for this one I had just never thought of it before -I want Mrs Weasley to knit me a sweater -The Mirror of Erised s inscription backwards says I show not your face but your heart s desire -In the book when Harry first finds the Mirror of Erised he sees a reflection of his mom dad and the rest of his family But in the film it only shows Lily and James That would ve been cool to see in the film -Apparently chess is the only thing that Hermione ever lost at p 217 If she is so smart don t you think she d be really good at the strategy of chess -After seeing Quirrell Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest Harry starts to have nightmares about the face dripping unicorn blood I wonder if this is Voldemort already using Occlumancy on Harry -In the film the protections that Harry Ron and Hermione have to get through to find the Sorcerer s Stone leave out the troll placed by Quirrel and the potions challenge Snape s Would ve been fun to see Hermione tackle that one -Voldemort s face on the back of Quirrell s head is described as pale with red slit eyes like a snake like movie Voldemort Why isn t that how they portrayed him in the first film -Also Neville s best exam grade was in Herbology Aww Overall I just thought it was remarkable to note how many things Rowling references already It makes me even more excited to jump right into Chamber of Secrets next more"
