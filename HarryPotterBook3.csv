"4","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"," Jun 26 2010"," Raeleen Lemay","it was amazing"," re-read in February 2016Harry is getting his sass on I love it Re-Read in December 2014 for Harry Christmas to YouOH MAN THIS BOOK IS SO MY FAVORITE The phone conversation at the beginning between Ron and Uncle Vernon was PRICELESS I wish so much that that scene had been in the movie I was so into reading this book that I failed to take notes so I don t have many specifics to add except that I love how Crookshanks was basically Sirius s secret agent spy cat friend and I LOVE THAT Also this book demonstrated some very REAL aspects of school For example Hermione took on too much work and she gradually started to go crazy and consequently distanced herself from her friends became more moody and then finally just bitch-slapped Malfoy I also found Oliver Wood to be hilarious in this book for similar reasons this was his last year at Hogwarts and he wanted nothing more than to win the Quidditch Cup so he could have some sort of glory at Hogwarts and he became so consumed by it as I m sure lots of people on sports teams do The way he was so emotionally invested really cracked me up but also felt so real Side note CEDRIC IS SO DAMN NICE when he realized that Harry fell off his broom during the Quidditch game and Hufflepuff won he called for a rematch which says a lot about him and it just makes what happens in the next book that much worse But of course all of the Marauders stuff made my inner fangirl go nuts because it has to be my favorite Harry Potter storyline I mean I didn t name my YouTube channel after them or anything Also time travel more"
"5","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"," Nov 25 2012"," Khanh first of her name mother of bunnies","it was amazing"," I last read this book when I was 14 years old given that I m almost 32 now I have a whole new perspective on it Despite the fact that I gave this book 5 stars previously I have to admit that it didn t grow on me until this my second read Confession time I didn t like Remus or Sirius Khanh ducks as rotten fruit and eggs are thrown her way OK OK I M SORRY I ve since changed my mind Notice that I used the past tense Obviously there will be spoilers for the book below for the 1 5 of you who haven t read this yet I can t even recall why this book wasn t memorable to me All I remembered was that Sirius - and what happened to him - was terrible but he s like meh to me I just never connected with him as a character Remus was a werewolf and I ve never liked werewolves The Marauders in general were just a bunch of rowdy teenaged boys and having been the target for teasing from rowdy rude teenaged boys in my youth I just didn t care for the way they were portrayed And I was right somewhat James et al weren t perfect They bullied Snape they were little shitheads Yes eventually they became productive admirable members of society but I just didn t like them at first I guess this is one of those books that just takes time to grow on you This is the last Harry Potter book in which Harry is a child Before his life - and this series - was visited by the spectre of death I m not talking about the long-ago deaths of James and Lily of course Harry has experienced deaths before but it was distant I m talking about the future deaths where Harry lost people he actually remembered and respected and loved That s what I mean when I say that this is the last book in which Harry is a child because as hard as his life was until now he still had his innocence Children believe that their heroes are unerring One of the rites of passage to adulthood is the realization that heroes fall like everyone else Harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground beneath him was falling sharply away He had grown used to the idea that Dumbledore could solve anything He had expected Dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air But no their last hope was gone I know that everyone loves Sirius but for some reason he didn t click for me when I was 14 This time around I could understand his character more I could relate to his desperation his frustration and the hope that kept him alive all those excruciating years in Azkaban I don t know how I did it he said slowly I think the only reason I never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent That wasn t a happy thought so the Dementors couldn t suck it out of me but it kept me sane I think for me it took maturity and the experience of loss and frustration well life itself in order to appreciate the hardship that Harry and Sirius and Remus went through Previously this was a magical Cinderella-like tale about a boy in a room under the stairs With this book the story became twisted and it became something more Read this review and more The Book Eaters more"

"8","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"," Feb 21 2011"," Katerina","it was amazing"," It s a rainy Sunday It s colder than it should be this time of the year so I m drinking a delicious cup of coffee and I m browsing my Goodreads shelves only to realise that I haven t written a Harry Potter review Not a single one So I decided to start with the first Harry Potter book I ever read the one that took me to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and made me believe that magic is something tangible I solemnly swear that I am up to no good I was 16 years old and I had just started my english classes in order to pass my Proficiency examinations My teacher told me that the best way to delve into a foreign language and familiarize with it is to read books written in it so she gave me the third instalment of Harry Potter Little did she know that she unleashed a beast who now reads almost exclusively in english Before I tell you about my experience I need to make a confession It was my choice to stay away from J K Rowling s books until that moment I wanted to swim against the current and I thought that Harry Potter was too mainstream for my taste And the foolish little me was proud of this decision But when my teacher gave me this old used copy something inside me cracked I knew the basics about the story about the orphan kid who goes to a school for wizards and fights the ugly evil dude who doesn t have a nose But page by page I came to understand with awe that the wizard who finds trouble even when he doesn t want to offers more than that he opened a portal to a world where I longed to be fervently I stayed up late at night with a faint light just enough to make out the sentences and I cheered for Gryffindor s Quidditch team I flied with Firebolt and I kept wondering what my patronus would be according to Pottermore it s a brown mastiff which is oddly fitting I casted spells but never Avada Kedavra you shouldn t play with this shit and tasted butterbeer in Hogsmeade and just like that my life had changed irrevocably I was a Potterhead And I was proud of that my mum wasn t though especially when I asked for a wand Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light There is a reason why J K Rowling is the fairy god-mother to millions of children and adults worldwide Friendship love hope they re present in her books even in the most desperate times when Evil seems undefeatable when no escape is visible She encourages and empowers shows that everything is possible that strength and courage can be found within when you have someone to hold your hand Harry was a kid who was deprived of love yet he was capable of loving it took him years but he finally found a place to belong to feel safe and cared Ron with his witty lines and his constant presence Hermione my personal favorite with her intelligence and compassion they managed to enchant my prejudiced heart and even now years later I m still under their spell I think I will always be Don t let the muggles get you down I m still waiting for my Hogwarts letter and secretly hope that Dobby is the one to blame I still caress with affection the spines of my Harry Potter books meanwhile I bought them all and finished the entire series in a week and a half and laugh at Harry Potter jokes And I know and it s imprinted in my soul that I ll never be a muggle again more"

"12","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"," Jan 31 2008"," Chris","really liked it"," Since pretty much everyone I know has read these books I figure reviewing them is pretty pointless But with the new book coming out in a couple of weeks I have to go through them beginning to end To make the reviews more entertaining I will be doing them in a variety of unexpected formats For this review I will be writing as Crookshanks fan fiction Crookshanks swished his tail back and forth as he crept up the stairs to the boys bedrooms He knew the rat wasn t what it was pretending to be but all of his attempts to alert the humans to this fact had failed I don t know why I even bother he muttered to himself I could get along fine without any of them Let the rat do whatever it is it s trying to do So long as Girl keeps feeding me and scratching my belly I ll - hello what s this He could smell the rat Its scent was like nothing Crookshanks had ever smelled and for all his time living in a magical pet shop he d smelled a lot The rat did smell like a rat yes but there was also something else Something human It was just like that big black dog he d met on the grounds the other day Every instinct in him had screamed to run away but there was that smell And even Crookshanks knew what they said about cats and curiosity The dog had turned out to be more than just a dog and it had convinced Crookshanks to help it First order of business retrieve a certain rat from the bedroom of the Red-Haired Boy The Boy wasn t in but the rat was Crookshanks circled the bed a few times This time maybe he would be able to get the damn thing He tensed for a moment and then leapt onto the bed By luck or skill he was nearly on top of the thing when he landed A-HA he yowled Gotcha He pinned the rat under his sizable paw Where you gonna run to now ratty he asked sneering as best he could The rat writhed in his grip Please it said Just let me go You don t know what will happen if you eat me it would be a terrible mistake A mistake eh the cat said We ll see about that I have a great big doggie friend who s just aching to get his jaws around you He barely had time to finish his sentence when the rat went mad It squealed and bit and slashed with its paws And then against all of Crookshanks previous experience - it grew It nearly threw the cat off the bed as it became much more massive - its legs lengthened and its arms stretched until it had reached a human size and shape Crookshanks goggled Of all the things he d expected from this rat this wasn t it The human grabbed at him but Crookshanks was too fast He jumped off the bed and shimmied under the wardrobe where he could see but not be seen The human looked around breathing heavily He was pale and thin and still looked ratty Think Peter think he said Gotta get out of here but He stopped glanced at the wardrobe and grimaced You may just have given me my way out cat he said And then he bit the ball of his hand Blood dripped out leaving spreading red blotches on the sheets They ll think it was you he said They ll leave me for dead and I ll be free to rejoin my Lord He looked at the recently repaired curtains on Ron s bed It s not safe here anymore He sucked at the wound to stop the bloodflow and then went to the window Perched on the windowsill he looked over at Crookshanks hiding place If I were human he said the fall would kill me But as a rat His body rippled and twisted and shrank and then there was an old grey rat on the sill Crookshanks was pretty sure it winked at him before leaping off After a minute or two Crookshanks wriggled out from under the wardrobe his thoughts dark The Red-Haired Boy was going to be angry and so was the Girl But more importantly the Dog was going to be furious It was barely holding on to its sanity as it was Crookshanks shook his head This was going to get worse before it would get better more"

"18","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"," Apr 06 2014"," Bookdragon Sean","it was amazing"," This is my favourite book in the Harry Potter series It marks a distinct change in tone and a maturation of the writing As the characters grew older the challenges they faced became more dark and intense The plot became murkier especially in regard to Sirius and his involvement or lack thereof in the murders of Potter s parents It all just got so much better I think this is a large part of Rowling s success She could have fell into a trap and continuously wrote books like the first two but instead she moved her story forward and let it grow And her readers rejoice This is also the first time the real threat to Harry is realised Sure we ve seen Voldemort on the back of Professor Quirrel s head and we saw an early Tom Riddle in the form of Horcorux diary type thing but the dementors were an entirely different level of danger The entire story felt less comic and less feel-good for the first time it seemed like Harry Potter could actually die if he didn t find his courage and repel them with his power He owed much to Lupin here a character who becomes slightly overlooked as the series progresses but a hugely pivotal one in the development of Harry And for me that s why this one is the best because eit is the one where Harry truly found his confidence more"

answers that right when you first meet her she isn t that socialising with her colleagues and attend feasts and meals in the Great Hall for her Inner Sight of course thought that was obvious And Hagrid Our New Teacher what a job man BUT a tricky-to-deal-with creatures in the first class Come on I love Hippogriffs I do but not that fast man Chapter Seven Bad Teacher Good Teacher From Snape class the worst kind of teachers Bullying favoritism etcTo the fun class of Lupin caring activity teaching etc But let s take a look at the Boggart here it lurks in the dark places that can be under bed in a closet opend a bit etc and it transform to whatever your mind thinks scary isn t it simply the boogyman theory You always don t know what s in the darkest corners but you know it s your worst nightmare I really love this concept explains a mysterious common fear into something magical something from this well crafted Wizardry World Chapter Eight Moving Portraits Always wondered since the first book when they re going to make a real better use of them Here was the answer -and trust me more useful uses in later books Chapter Nine Open Page 394 A new mystery thrown where s Lupin and what s Snape is doing to him God If we can read the clues as plain as Hermione did when she opend page Three Hundred Ninety Four Chapter Ten The Marauders Well I m not talking just about the Map here though I needed BIGGER illustrated page of it may be folded one as DA in book one BUT I m talking about that we didn t know back when we overheard the conversation in the Three Broomsticks of the story of how Black killed Pettigrew after betraying James Potter THAT was actually about Three of the Four Marauders Chapter Eleven F R I E N D S and Betrayal This two chapters are mostly about that Friendship and betrayal sometimes you don t know who will betrayed who as the case of Sirius Black story and the secret keeper story of the previous chapter Burt sometimes what a friend may call a betrayal can be just a good intentions deed On Hermione snitching about the Firebolt I m talking about Oh and in the same chapter Thirteen dine on one table on Christmas eve talk about Friends and Betraying symbols and I needed this scene illustrated so much it s a Betrayal to not be included Chapter Twelve Expecto Patrounam Or The importance of keeping Happy Memories in hand my Patrounas is a cat thought that was obvious Chapter Thirteen Quidditch never been more exciting They didn t have a complete Quidditch season in both Book One and Book Two did you noticed so Or even cared with everything going on every end of the previous two years I don t think so -I had to look it up online why Gryffindor didn t won for 9 years it was 7 in the first book and I find out that the Internet already full with that question -and good answer seekers - But it s Oliver Wood our beloved Gryffindor Quidditch Captain s last year in Hogwarts so it matters now And with the Grim Defeat few chapters ago this chapter with Gryffindor Vs Ravenclaw was really exciting Till the cliffhanger end Oh forget did you noticed that Cho Chang a year older than Harry Chapter Fourteen Your father did something Snape could never forgive What He saved his life -Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone Since Book One ever wondered how Sure we did Here s a finally 2 years later a glimpse of how did Harry s Father saved Snape s life yet still Snape isn t grateful as you might think Chapter Fifteen The Quidditch really Matter in this book Guess I already told you so it is since the first game of the year First time to behold the Cup only later in book 5 will do again oh the Symmetry Chapter Sixteen Exams I always love the Exams chapter in every book though it s mostly hasty just summing up all the exams so I always wish to have more of it Trelawney makes her second accurate prediction but we don t know that yet only later in this book Oh and you ll never know what was her first untill much later in Book Five again which is Book Three Symmetry Twin Oh and here we say Goodbye -maybe- to Buckbeak But that what was the trigger to the Climax of the book Chapter Seventeen Cat Rat and Dog Look no matter how exciting the re-reads of Harry Potter I can t never forget the chill I got first time I read this couple of chapters This CLIMAX this Jigsaw of a story where all the puzzle pieces fall in one epic breath-holding breathtaking at the same time clever mystery revealing Chapters It all starts with Cat Rat and Dog I m just in love with the naming of this one That continues in Chapter Eighteen Moony Wormtail Padfoot and Prongs The Marauders Their past story that full of twists and the mystery of The Prisoner is clearing now Still there was more questions but Snape crashed into the present as he did in the past But everything get cleared when we learn The True- Chapter Nineteen -Servant of Lord Voldemort God A huge revelation that back to the Night when Harry s parents got betrayed and killed and how Harry got his ride in the motorcycle with Hagrid is finally shown in full and clear in the story Oh yes Black been mentioned from the very early beginning remember Borrowed it Professor Dumbledore sir said the giant climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke Young Sirius Black lent it to me I ve got him sir -Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone And the Climax chapters end tragically wrong with - Chapter Twenty - Dark Night despite the Full Moon Very dark chapter indeed Now take a breath Remember back when we first read these chapters made us thought that Crockshanks might be Harry s Father God that was wild I remember many theories that kept growing till before the release of book 7 that he s actually alive Also now we get it that the Sneakoscope that Harry got at the beginning of this book as a present from Ron wasn t malfunctioned after all Scrabbers was there dah Well I d do anything to get a Time Machine so I d go back and read this mystery all over again with the same excitement and awe I felt with every twist But why buy a complicated Time Machine when we have - Chapter Twenty One - Hermione s Secret The Time Turner Here where you re-read the Climax of the novel but in Back in Time mode and they didn t change anything everything already happened I loved the little perfect rules Rowling did for this twist Technically they didn t change fate nothing happened have been changed I just love that I always love the Time stories and this beautiful illustration But sure it s a tricky plot And Rowling herself regretted doing it later cause always fans -probably herself too even the characters in her Wizardry World- would ask What If we used a Time Turner for this or that She tried in Book Five symmetry twin to close the matter of Time Turners but not until The Cursed Child that it closed once and for all Well I believe that s why I will always appreciate it no matter how the hates it get from many fans Chapter Twenty Two The Last Symmetry And always the last Chapter symmetrically with the first These little things from every Chapter even the first must be concluded here Sometimes last chapters makes me widely smile or have teary eyes -as in the next book- but mostly smile Remember that the Dursley already watched Black in the news Ron is Pet-less after the whole Cat Rat struggle the whole year The Grindylow s empty cage Oh and who send the Firebolt -I know it s obvious when it s a re-readers or those who watched the movie or those who read with extra Hermione-care By the way why it never thought by anyone that it could be Professor McGonagall again as she got him Nimbus 2000 in book one Well always last chapter is this one where all the little pieces come together and Harry is off to the Muggle world with the Dursley with happier thoughts This time we have a line that will make us on fire for book Four The World Cup for Quidditch is coming this summer See you there Harry Mohammed ArabeyThe Illustrated Edition ReadFrom 24 Nov 2017To 7 Dec 2017This Review made for the love of the series the creative inspiring work it s done in this series and for the love of all the fellow Potterheads more"
"29","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"," Jan 01 2017"," emma","really liked it"," This - is my review of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban It s a great book - but not without its problems D you get it It s because every goddamn sentence of this book contains either a dash or an ellipsis That s one of the problems https emmareadstoomuch wordpress co I m debating whether to unleash the anti-Snape rant that s been building up inside me for a decade now I think I ll wait until his supposedly redeeming backstory is revealed What book is that in Anyway just his extensive presence in this book made the whole thing less fun for me I feel about Snape the way Michael Scott feels about Toby But I digress My main thing with this book is that Rowling can be kind of bad at fitting the parameters of the universe she created That s understandable since it s immense and so impressive but there s also little common sense things that get under my skin This would be under general stupidity if I hated this book - which I absolutely don t I wanted to be having a great time but instead I was caught up in the little mistakes Some examples There s just no way McGonagall would have given Hermione the Time Turner No way I get the significance of the thing to the plot and it s a really creative and entertaining concept but my girl Minerva would NEVER have handed that over This is the woman who will shut any student down take Harry Potter s broom deduct points from her own team throw shade at Trelawney what I m saying is she s a one hundred percent badass And she s a badass who exudes said badassery with the well-being of all Hogwarts students in mind But I m supposed to believe she put herself out there petitioned the government and presumably put in effort to convince her fellow faculty just so Hermione could take a purely overwhelming number of classes Nah She would have recognized it as unnecessary Hermione never even gives a reason beyond wanting to for her overloaded schedule and a huge pressure workload s making a thirteen year old cry all the time and lose the ability to sleep In other words Minerva would have shut that shit down in a hot Texas minute But wait - I have more examples Lupin tells us that when he was at Hogwarts they went through an INSANE amount of work to get him off the grounds when he underwent his transformation Keep in mind this whole thing is for one Effing Student They put in a magic violent tree the infamous Whomping Willow dig a tunnel that is presumably at least a mile or two long and mess with build a shack-like shelter This is way way way too much to ensure that a single student can attend the school But even suspending your disbelief there - why would you put a werewolf inside a WEAK SHUT UP BUILDING to protect people One don t put a rabid monstrous creature in a house because two he can break out of it and now the inhabitants of Hogsmeade are at risk Also putting in the Whomping Willow Are you kidding me It s a danger to the students And so is building a passageway in out There are so so so many more problems than solutions here And here s the most wild laughable one for me At the end Sirius Black reveals that it was him - HIM - who bought Harry Potter the Firebolt hundreds-of-Galleons price tag and all This is INSANE Since Ron had earlier mentioned that it would have been impossible for Black to buy a broomstick J K is so kind as to reveal how he did it in his letter to Harry He says he sent Crookshanks a f cking cat to the Owl Post had him order the broomstick under Harry s name and had it charged to his own bank account at Gringotts HAHAHAHA WHAT You re telling me a goddamn cat walked into a post office conveyed the information that Harry Potter was ordering the most expensive broom on the market and charged it to the most wanted man in Britain s account without consequence Like everyone was just like yeah okay we didn t really want to find him anyway We won t bring this up to the Ministry or Potter or anything Jeeessssuuuuussss Also how did my guy have that much money in his account anyway How is his account even open Also I know this is well-discussed but there is just so much conflicting information about how many people attend Hogwarts It drives me insane I ll never be satisfied with one answer because there are always a million other pieces of evidence that conflict The sheer confusion of the story relayed in the Shrieking Shack was also so confusing Like I get why there had to be a dozen f cking pages of Black Lupin begging the story to be told and Hermione Ron Harry essentially covering their ears and singing Walking on Sunshine but they couldn t at least have told the story with some semblance of organization once they finally got there I mean Jesus On the other hand characters Hermione is still killin it - Time Turner baby And slaying those exams But she did have less time with the squad fighting and a lot of scenes where it was just like Oh Yeah Hermione Uh she s doing homework over there Plus Neville was not really included like at all But Lupin was introduced and he s one of my favorites But Snape was here as hell and I hate him so much But no Colin Creevey or Lockhart or Dobby But Trelawney and Malfoy and Pansy But Sirius But mainly he was villain-ing it up Oh well It s a real 50 50 in this one Still it was definitely enjoyable Like I read it in pretty much one sitting and I haven t done that in a whileeee I missed doing it And this was so so much better than the second book So this is so hard to rate I am having a really hard time here you guys And my absolute favorite aspect of these books - which was missing in the second volume - was one hundred percent present and accounted for I m talking a look into the world baby We get Hogsmeade we get an entire fortnight of Diagon Alley we get a bunch of discussion of the school and the classes Even the bad parts like Azkaban Ugh I could read a series worth of books just on the world I swear So bottom line In some ways I liked this as much as the first but it definitely had more problems I am looking forward to continuing my reread and hopin I find just as much of the world and even more of the good characters Goblet of Fire I expect to see you soon more"

"71","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"," Feb 08 2016"," jamieson","it was amazing"," Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is probably my second favourite Harry Potter book I always find myself getting ridiculously emotional about the Marauders J K Rowling that is the story you should reallyy write who even cares about Harry s kids smh The thing is I just care about Harry alot As if he was me actual son or my little brother I just really want Harry to be happy and I feel like he and kind of his history backstory is given so much depth in POA The connection between Harry and Sirius and Harry finally finding a father figure in both Lupin and Sirius is really important to me as well as them providing a framework for him being able to get to know his parents I find the whole Marauder s story kind of tragic - with Lupin Sirius losing their best friend and due to Peter s betrayal 13 years worth of time with Harry and so the huge focus of the marauders in this book just makes it an absolute favourite of mine The ending of the book where Harry gets his letter from Sirius and reads it over and over and is just so happy makes me happy like bb you deserve all the happiness in the world ANYWAY psa this book gets MUCH SADDER each time you reread When you reread it knowing everything about the past and future of these characters it is much much sadder Like Lupin saying he knew James and Sirius in school KNEW HIM SHUT UP THEY WERE YOUR BEST FRIENDS AND YOU LOVED THEMOr like Hagrid talking about how Sirius was there when James and Lily died OH GOD AND IT MAKES ME SO SAD because you know he was wrongly arrested hours later arrghhh I also think that the Quidditch matches in this book are some of the best in the whole series - the one where Gryffindor win the Quidditch Cup is THE BEST of the series hands down On top of that we also see time travelling Hermione Hagrid as a teacher Hermione being a total badass damn that hit on Malfoy tho and breaking rules all over the place HARRY GETTIN HIS FIREBOLT a pivotal moment in the young kids life ok Lupin actually being a good DATDA teacher Harry the sexual awakening Cho Chang got him feeling things omfg the Boggart scene Harry learning to cast a partonus Buckbeak Hogsmede and that damn perfect scene where Fudge talk about Sirius Ron getting Pig the Marauders Map -- Fred George study in this one and an emotional chat between Dumbledore and Harry about his parents and his choices which was such a perfect conclusion to the book honestly Also can we talk about how gloriously Harry s sass shows in this one because he was quippin all over the placeI love POA so much it s probably the only book I literally wish was longer I honestly ACHE for more of this I know there is nothing else But for real when I get to the last page I still feel like where is the rest It doesn t NEED more I just love it so much I wish there was more more"
"72","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"," Nov 22 2008"," Jason Koivu","it was amazing"," Shit got real For me Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was when the series got exciting It certainly got darker and more mature Torture loss a foreboding sense of dread and death itself descended upon this happy little world of magic where school exams and difficult professors were the worst things to worry about until recently I m a big fan of the tone The series jumps right into its bigboy pants here As an adult reading these books I was glad to see the maturity Yeah it s still YA and not targeted towards me but at least now it felt a little closer to something in my old man range As mentioned before there s an ever present element of death in The Prisoner of Azkaban Those ghoulish dementors are death itself However it also introduced a reason for Harry to want to live his godfather a connection to his parents Up until then there was little joy in Harry s life Sure there was the school but that would end soon enough Rowling did a smart thing when she introduced Sirius Black she gave Harry a human bond and something to lose As readers our attachment grew with his That was when Harry became real to me more"
"73","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"," Dec 17 2015"," Councillor","it was amazing"," Is there any way to write a review on any of the Harry Potter books without doing it injustice Nearly nobody attempts to create a full review on this series because of 1 its popularity 2 its huge fanbase and 3 its awesomeness in general And neither will I do so The first book was fantastic although I read it probably ten years too late in my life The second book was not so fantastic but still a great book And the third one completely blew my mind I wanted to write a review on this book I even started a checklist to keep track of what I wanted to add here But the further I delved into the stories about the Prisoner of Azkaban the more did I realize that the only things I was going to say were X is awesome Y rocks and Z simply has to be the winner The only aspect which might be criticized about this book might be the fact that some characters like Voldemort Malfoy or on the other hand Harry Hermione or Ron are relatively black or white evil or good But I don t mind Because Those Characters Are Amazing Hagrid and Lupin are my new favorites after reading this book And I want more of Hedwig because - owls In contrast to the two previous books the pace is so wonderfully matching in this book Just at the right time before the descriptions of the Hogwarts school year all of them contributing to the entire plot might turn too extensive the story climbs up to its climax and concludes within one hundred pages of incredible tension Logical relevations long-desired confrontations and a lot of surprises will accompany you during your journey with Harry and his friends resulting in the convergence of several different plotlines which were established during the course of the novel Most of the people I know have read this book but if you happen to be one of the few exceptions then go read it Maybe you fear it because of its fantasy elements I ve never been a fan of fantasy either but this book series changed my opinion Maybe you fear it because of its popularity Don t be afraid The hype is completely justified My reviews in the Harry Potter series 1 Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone Go to review2 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Go to review more"

"79","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"," Mar 24 2011"," Micheline","it was amazing"," Harry Potter the Prisoner of Azkaban has always been in my opinion one of the best books of the series Even as far as the movies go I feel that PoA is by far the best book to film adaptation out of all 8 movies Yes Harry Potter and Ron and Hermione are still fairly young in the third book but I find they have matured quite a bit this time around They re officially in their teens and they ve already had their fair share of adventures This time around however Harry has more to worry about than just Voldemort as if that wasn t already enough Harry s Summer vacation at the Dursley s take a turn for the worse when Uncle Vernon s vile sister Marge comes to visit She is completely horrible to Harry and by comparison makes his Aunt Uncle look almost human After a disastrous visit ends abruptly lol Harry finds himself spending his last two weeks of Summer vacation in Diagon Alley I always feel so happy about Harry being able to soak in his magical surroundings and do as he pleases I mean how fun would it be to hang out in Diagon Alley The writing here is above reproach I read somewhere that J K Rowling said that when she had finished writing Half Blood Prince she hadn t been that satisfied with a book since The Prisoner of Azkaban and I think it shows this is Rowling at her best There are so many new magical elements added in the mix this time The Maurauder s Map the discovery of the identity of the Maurauders themselves the Dementors are absolute nightmares view spoiler I ve always found it incredibly telling of Harry that his Boggart is NOT Voldemort but a Dementor Like Lupin says Harry s worst fear is fear itself And Lupin is right it is really brave hide spoiler the Patronus charms are really cool and always have me imagining what I think my own Patronus would be I also really enjoy the visits the the wizarding village of Hogsmeade the only all wizard settlement in London view spoiler Now as for a few of the best elements of Prisoner of Azkaban Remus Lupin Sirius Black Lupin is the first competent Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher we ve ever been introduced to But as a character he s quite tragic but I just adore him He s kind and capable and his bond with Harry is truly special He happens to have the same birthday as me though and that s pretty cool And after reading the book thinking one thing about Sirius Black finding out the truth is staggering and wonderful all at once Sirius is and always will be one of my favorite characters in the series and meeting him the way we do is a treat even without the mystery involved the first time around Also The 30 minutes Harry believes he ll be able to move in with Sirius sigh and have something close to a home and a family Again it s tragic but beautiful hide spoiler As usual the book ends with the requisite Dumbledore Harry heart to heart And Dumbledore always contributes a hint at a key plot element that will come to play again later on in the story view spoiler There will come a time when Harry is grateful he saved Pettigrew s life hide spoiler Upon rereading you really get to savour that expert foreshadowing It s brilliant to see how it all fits together in the end every little detail is woven into the plot for a reason Not many authors can ever dream of accomplishing such a feat but J K Rowling does it seamlessly The Prisoner of Azkaban is one of my absolute favorite books in the world From the very first sentence where Rowling re-introduces us to our beloved hero by telling us how strange he is I was and still am in love I adore the tone the new characters and how Harry and co have obviously matured and grown so much already The feels are strong for this one more"

"105","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"," Oct 16 2016"," Leonard Gaya","really liked it"," The Harry Potter books are a bit of a puzzle The series started to get into print only twenty years ago It was initially intended despite the massive page count of these novels as a young boy s read Today it s already the best-selling book series in human history half a billion copies sold to date the most translated literary work and as a result one of the most read piece of literature in the world just behind the Bible and neck and neck with Don Quixote 1605 Why is that I kept asking myself while reading The Prisoner of Azkaban This third instalment in the series is indeed an excellent sample of Bildungsroman As in The Philosopher s Stone and The Chamber of Secrets we follow the adventures of a young orphan boy who lives during summer in South East England with his cruel foster parents a parody of Victor Hugo s Th nardiers or Dickens s Murdstones We also know from the first book -and just from general knowledge- that Harry Potter has magical powers As the school year begins he joins his two friends Ron and Hermione and goes to Hogwarts a boarding school for young wizards and witches The different classes alternate held by a rather flamboyant staff Dumbledore McGonagall Snape Hagrid etc There s a Quidditch -magical team sport- championship going on where Harry is a crucial element a bit too much of that stuff to my mind There s the nasty foolish brat Malfoy and his gang with whom he has to struggle But above all else there s a mystery plot going on that involves Harry and the evil forces the archenemy Voldemort and his gang is marshalling against him Many plot twists and mythological tropes later and right at the end of school year the mystery is lifted as in Agatha Christie s novels and Harry and his friends are victorious This brief spoiler-free summary calls for a couple of comments that might shed some light on a few of the reason why the Harry Potter books kindle so much enthusiasm for so many readers The setting contributes to a strange sense of realism The world building is extensive but unlike most fantasy novels set in wholly imaginary worlds J K Rowling manages to structure the surroundings of her books as an in-between It s a world where people can seamlessly go back and forth between the mundane Dursleys house in Surrey King s Cross station in London and the poetic and imaginary Diagon Alley Hogwarts School the village of Hogsmeade This odd sort of magical realism somehow suggests that the magic world is real and unseen rather than merely fictional The plot framework is identical to that of the first two instalments Only some characters change as well as the nature of the mystery Harry needs to solve It naturally could be seen as a repetitive almost predictable story But I suspect that this sort of variation on the same efficient firmly established scenario is part of the pleasure these books provide The very pleasure children may draw from hearing the same bedside story over and over again the very joy we as adults take from watching TV series that develop the same overall plot over and over Furthermore the general story isn t incredibly original the story of the poor orphan who discovers he has extraordinary powers and eventually becomes a celebrity is nothing short of Cinderella s or The Ugly Duckling s plot There s an excellent video with Kurt Vonnegut on the Cinderella-type plot But this is in fact a story that lets the readers secretly sense or hope that they are more than what they and others might think It s a call to a better Self Edited to add note that the plot around Harry Potter is very similar to the one around Luke Skywalker Star Wars a lad of humble origins who must fight a monstrous devil a group of assorted chums various challenges overcome the evil defeated against all odds etc People love that story Whereas most of the characters in the story are well drawn and colourful think Hagrid Hermione Snape even Pettigrew -a shrewd invention on Rowling s part the very character of Harry even though he is like a hub in the middle of everything else comes across as somewhat bland and bloodless In a way Harry Potter a common name is a blank figure and just as Ulysses he could say my name is no-one Or in other words my name is potentially everyone including you faithful reader I am a mirror of your life In the end the one and almost only thing Harry Potter profoundly expresses is his unconditional love for his deceased parents in a word a feeling of endless mourning This albeit a bit maudlin is perhaps one of the most profound things the Harry Potter novels convey what is truly magical and precious isn t the many tricks and spells taught at Hogwarts It is the past love that in some way or other we received at the beginning of our lives and which goes on through friendship A final note the best part of The Prisoner of Azkaban is probably the last hundred pages and especially the story around the Time-Turner device Alfonso Cuar n s film manages to make the most of it in what is perhaps the best of all the Harry Potter movie adaptations more"

"108","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"," Dec 01 2011"," Stepheny","it was amazing"," My own journey with Harry Potter started a long time ago But when Delee mentioned she had never read it before I knew I had to change that And I think some deeper part of her understood that if our friendship were to stand the test of time she would have to read them When she gave 5 stars to book 1 I knew I had her And sure enough we made our way to Chamber of Secrets I was unsure what she would make of the second book It seems to be the most criticized Many state that it is too much like the first one and that it doesn t serve much purpose I tend to give people a heads up that the first 3 books of the series in general are aimed at a much younger crowd than the last 4 I have to say I was shocked but very excited to see that once again Delee had given 5 shiny stars to Chamber as well So here we are Our journey began in March of 2014 and I have been trying my best to be a patient and understanding leader Sometimes I take her hand and gently guide her other times I chase her with a wooden spoon threatening severe punishments if she doesn t commit to a date to begin the next book But I do try to be patient I hope she knows that We picked up another buddy for this read- The Enchanting Ivonne When it comes to the world of Harry Potter there is little that I am unfamiliar with And there is even less that I won t do to get people to read it Now that Delee has the third book under her belt I think it will take less and less persuasion to get her on board for the next one In fact we finished this one in December and we re starting Goblet in March MARCH That s not that far away Prisoner has been a fan favorite since it came out I think it was one of the most popular of the movies as well But it has never been my favorite Obviously I still love it and it s a wonderful book but in the grand scheme of things it falls lower on my list than most other Pottheads A crazy murdering psycho is on the loose His name is Sirius Black and he has somehow escaped the Wizard prison- Azkaban No one and I do mean no one has ever done this before Now this isn t some wimpy old Muggle prison like Alcatraz We are talking the big time here folks The place is packed with dementors They suck the happiness and life right out of you They make you so incredibly sad and sorrowful that you ll be left with no hope So how did Black do it How was he able to remain sane in a place as awful as Azkaban They say he was lucid and even downright chatty whenever the Minister for Magic had to do a check on the prison Is he just that crazy that the dementors don t affect him Most importantly- why did he escape But Harry soon finds out that Black has come to finish what he started 12 years earlier He has come to kill Harry Prisoner offers a break in what was perceived as the formula In this one we learn to battle our depression We learn to find our happiest moments in our weakest and most awful ones We learn to forgive and we learn to show mercy We learn what it means to have a second chance And we are introduced to Buckbeak Prisoner of Azkaban is a great story and added a nice dynamic to the Harry Potter series It is the only one like it within the series where the other ones can be compared fairly easily to one another I am so thankful to have such an incredible friend agree to accompany me on this journey I am so thankful that she trusts me to guide her But mostly I am so thankful that we can share these stories together It is a bonding experience like no other more"

"154","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"," Apr 09 2015"," Steve","it was amazing"," Now this is where Rowling strikes gold I thought AZKABAN was not only easily the best of first three but one of the best books I ve read in a long time The storyline is easily the strongest of the first three installments and for once Voldemort is not the main villain driving the plot but a renegade supporter who murdered 13 people with a single curse What makes Azkaban so interesting is learning about the relationships between James Potter Remus Lupin Sirius Black Peter Pettigrew and Severus Snape Rowling introduces a new magical artifiact called the Marauder s Map which she uncharacteristically fully explains by the end of the novel The map shows you the location of everyone on the Hogwarts grounds a tremendously useful item supplied appropriately enough by those masters of mischief Fred and George Another great new bit of magic in the book is the Patronus a magical spell that will help fight back the dementors and fear a very advanced piece of magic for third year students There are many memorable scenes and events and there s a lot more key information revealed about Harry s past On to the next one more"

"160","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"," Jul 25 2009"," Greg","really liked it"," My Harry Potter ApologyA couple of summers ago I tried to read Harry Potter I expected to be unimpressed and I was was The first two novels in the series are unspectacular After reading more children s literature recently I ve realized that they are fairly standard fair for the kiddie fantasy genre but that still left me wondering why everyone cared so much about this little nerdling If I hadn t engrossed myself in books for kids this summer I probably wouldn t have ever gotten decided to give Harry Potter another chance I needed to figure out why why was this series so popular What makes this a huge cultural phenomena while a book series like Percy Jackson is only a best-seller that adults don t jizz themselves over Having read two of the PJ and HP I decided I needed to investigate this a little more It didn t hurt that I was bored last weekend and watched the second Harry Potter movie and found myself enjoying it and actually watched it all in one sitting something I haven t done for a movie in months Ok Going into HP3 I was skeptical I found the PJ s first two novels if not better than more interesting They were about Greek mythology and while silly at times they were a pretty fun take on all of the creatures and God s met in The Odyssey I ll take stories involving Athena and Gorgons over Dumbledore and Voldemort any day Strangely I was wrong about Harry Potter I hate to admit when my prejudices are wrong but apparently I am not infallible While I still stand behind my judgment of books one and two being fairly fun but predictable and too episodic for my taste book three seemed to move drastically beyond the almost cookie-cutter quality of Rowling s first two forays and created a very full world that had enough depth to the characters and actions that I stopped feeling like I was being dragged along by the nose through an unengaging text I don t know what to really say except I really ended up enjoying it enough so that I looked forward to starting book 4 which I have started but have to say isn t living up to this book so far When I was shamefully buying this book a cashier told me that this was her favorite in the series Someone else stopped to tell me while I sat on the stoop behind work that it was their favorite too I m wondering if this is the pinnacle of the series and that after this it just becomes a need to keep on reading hoping that the heights of book 3 will be reached again and feeling compelled to finish a series that one could feel very invested in I don t know As a side note I had the thought that while I made fun of adults who loudly proclaimed their love for the HP books especially around the time when the fourth one came out this was the moment the little nerdling entered on to my myopic cultural radar and I had my initial disgust at reading newspaper articles with adults saying they love the books and they aren t kids books blah blah blah I kind of get what they are saying I don t agree with them I don t think it s the greatest thing ever written and I have lots of books I liked more than this one but for a person who reads shitty books and lives on a diet of Grisham and Patterson with some other easy to digest cookie cutter adult novelists thrown in this book would read like literature more"
"161","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"," Apr 01 2013"," Krystal","really liked it"," Alright I was a little harsh initially giving this two stars It s probably one of my favourite books of the series because it s all about my main man Sirius the titular prisoner Who doesn t love a bad boy am I right I love the drama in this book It s so much more exciting with a rogue evil wizard running about wreaking havoc and Lupin is pretty cool and brings out the absolute worst in Snape which is frustrating but also hilarious at the same time I mentioned in a previous review that I love that he s a total jerk to Harry and he s particularly vindictive in this book That being said I totally don t blame him When he pops in to cover Lupin s class they re all little turds to him and incredibly disrespectful He s still a teacher you know Show some respect Snape s reactions in that scene are totally justified in my mind I do feel a little sorry for Neville though Poor kid can never catch a break I love that Lupin s classes open up the world of magical creatures within this series Finally we re seeing a little more in the world-building and that s also assisted by the kids taking on different classes Mind you Divination is pretty dull Shame Harry didn t take some of the same extra classes Hermione did because I d have much preferred to read about those There s a lot more mystery and intrigue in this book which makes it a lot more exciting and brings back that sense of magical adventure that the first book had The Weasley twins crop up a bit more too which is always fun On the down side there s way too much quidditch That stuff really bores me Was it really necessary to give us the play-by-play of not just one but three games yawns Harry and his bloody broomstick obsession honestly Also the boys have gone back to treating Hermione like crap which I dislike immensely Ron does most of the bullying but Harry totally goes along with it Hagrid took the words out of my mouth when he reprimanded them for it Those boys are rubbish friends really Hermione on the other hand is at the top of her game She s a total badass now and I love her for it This book is a lot stronger than the previous because it s a fresh glimpse at the same world Where the second book just introduced a new situation this book provided further insight into the world of Hogwarts introducing new characters classes magic places and history There s so much more to get excited about and it s all topped by the thrilling mystery of Sirius Black and his evil doings happy sigh I really love that guy If the second book left you in a HP slump this should restore you again Much more creative and therefore enjoyable more"

"189","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"," Apr 03 2017"," edge of bubble","it was amazing"," The most annoying scene in the entire series happens in this book view spoiler where sirius and lupin keep trying to explain what s going on and who peter is without actually saying anything that makes sense and they keep going on and on trying to convince harry to trust them but only making not trustworthy cyrptic comments so aggravating hide spoiler That scene was even more maddening in the audible version All that idiotic misunderstandings and non-explanations Harry is a bit better in this book but Fry and his love for reading words with emphasis a lot is getting a bit ear-scratchy more"

"205","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"," Aug 15 2016"," Shahad takleef","it was amazing"," This Was The Best So Far This book is a turning point for the series for several reasons the first is that the characters are growing up into their more mature selves and with that the book s also growing more deceitful around the twists and the terror is blinking at harry closer than ever the world building is expanding and there is the appearance of many important characters those having much future influence like Sirius Maybe I am biased to consider it a turning point because Sirius black is always one of my top favorite characters i dare say even more favorite than Harry Potter himself professor Lupin and even the Dementors Then JK Rowling s words have this curious habit of coming to life so vivid it sucks you into the HP world then yo are unaware of anything else her characters are funny and realistic Fred and George the soul of the comedy of this series they NEVER fail to give me good chuckles every few pages and I love the whole Quidditch matches and Lee jordan hilarious commentary You can also clearly glimpse the clever plot Rowling has wove the cleverly placed foreshadowing and the innocent hints I always loved the movie Now I love the Book even more All in all its Fantastic what else can I say more"

"245","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"," Dec 28 2013"," Always Reading","it was amazing"," InhaltDiesmal l uft in den Ferien schon alles so schief dass Harry bef rchten muss aus Hogwarts rauszufliegen weil er seine unertr gliche Muggeltante Magda mit einem Schwebezauber an die Zimmerdecke bef rdert hat und dann ganz einfach abgehauen ist Und w hrend er sich noch ausmalt ein Leben als Verbannter zu f hren f ngt ihn das Zaubereiministerium ein und er landet zu seiner eigenen Verbl ffung p nktlich zum Schulbeginn im Schloss Doch jetzt geht der rger erst richtig los Wieso versteckt sich ein in allen Welten gef rchteter Verbrecher im Schloss Wie konnte er berhaupt eindringen Und wieso ist er eigentlich gerade hinter Harry her Irgendwie scheint Harry die Sache viel komplizierter als man ihn glauben machen m chte Gemeinsam mit seinen Freunden Ron und Hermine versucht er ein Geflecht aus Verrat Rache Verleumdung und Feigheit aufzudr seln und st t dabei auf schier unglaubliche Dinge die ihn fast an seinem Verstand zweifeln lassen Meine Meinung Harry Potter und der Gefangene von Askaban setzt wenige Woche nach dem Vorg nger an das Wichtigste wird nochmal im richtigen Moment erkl rt und dann geht es auch schon relativ schnell los mit den Geschehnissen Der Leser muss also nicht erst ewig lange warten und sich durch unz hlige Wiederholungen und Erkl rung qu len um mal etwas Spannendes zu lesenDie Protagonisten werden lter und entwickeln sich dementsprechend weiter Sie erreichen jetzt langsam die Pubert t und demnach r cken auch immer mal wieder Teenieprobleme in den Vordergrund Ebenso wie sich der Humor weiterentwickelt auf positive Art und Weise Ich bin ja kein gro er Fan von pubertierenden Teenies doch ich muss Harry Ron und Hermine lassen dass sie nicht so unausstehlich werden wie manch anderer Auch wenn man ber einige Entscheidungen und Aussagen einfach nur den Kopf sch tteln kann Immerhin denken sie jetzt einen Schritt weiter und st rzen sich nicht komplett kopflos in das n chste Problem Auch entwickelt sich die Freundschaft des Trios kontinuierlich weiter J K Rowling hat ein H ndchen f r realistische Freundschaften sie legt viel Wert auf die kleinen Dinge das Nebens chliche das Allt gliche was eine Freundschaft ber Jahre hinweg formt Nat rlich verl uft nicht alles reibungslos Es gibt kleine Streitereien und auch mal einen gro en Streit aber all das ist vollkommen normal Wenn ich mal daran denke wor ber ich mich in diesem Alter mit meinen M dels gestritten habe Das w rde uns heutzutage mit Anfang Mitte zwanzig gar nicht mehr einfallen wegen solchen Sachen auch nur ein bisschen beleidigt zu sein Der Schulalltag ist immer noch der absolute Knaller Erschaffen mit so viel Sorgfalt an jeder Ecke gibt es Details die nicht immer sofort auffallen Wieso ist Hogwarts nicht echt Ich bin jetzt vielleicht nicht jemand der die N chte durch lernt doch in Hogwarts w rde ich breit grinsend die Nacht durchackern Die Lehrer und Mitsch ler sind st ndig teil des Geschehens und einige Auserw hlte r cken auch immer mal wieder in den Vordergrund Es ist wirklich schade dass man bisher nicht viel ber die Hintergrundgeschichten einzelner Personen erfahren hat Ich finde sowas ja immer hochinteressant und interessiere mich durchaus f r die Vorgeschichte von einigen Charakteren Auch der Rest der Zaubererwelt wird nun etwas mehr ausgeweitet Da w ren zum Beispiel das Dorf Hogsmeade und das Gef ngnis Askaban J K Rowling erweitert ihre Welt also nachdem sie innerhalb ihrer eigenen Mythologie auch wirklich eine Daseinsberechtigung f r diese Orte gefunden hat Sie zaubert also nichts v llig sinnlos herbei und erwartet dann dass man das schluckt In Harry Potter und der Gefangene von Askaban werden auch die Dementoren eingef hrt die allgemein bekannt ja Depressionen darstellen sollen F r einen Menschen wie mich der Depressionen hatte und sie besiegt hat ist diese Darstellung auf einer Ebene ber hrend die sich andere Menschen vielleicht gar nicht wirklich vorstellen k nnen Wie sch n w re es doch gewesen die Depressionen mit einem h bschen Expecto Pratonum zu verjagen Doch auch die eigentliche Handlung kommt diesmal nicht zu kurz Die Autorin streut immer wieder Kleinigkeiten ein die oft nicht wichtig erscheinen und nicht wirklich auffallen weil genau das einfach ihren Schreibstil ausmacht Doch diese Details werden sp ter aufgegriffen und ergeben dann am Ende Sinn und tragen zur L sung des R tsels bei Die neuen Charaktere die hier im Vordergrund stehen Sirius und Lupin sind interessant und gut geschrieben und ich h tte mir noch viel mehr von ihnen gew nscht Ich finde sie funktionieren sehr gut zusammen und ich finde die gemeinsame Geschichte alter Freunde ja eh immer toll F r sowas kann ich mich richtig begeistern wenn Menschen gemeinsam viel durchgemacht haben und sich jahrelang bereits kennen Allgemein ist die komplette Geschichte um die Rumtreiber sehr vielversprechend auch wenn sie etwas hastig erz hlt wurde Durch diese neuen Charaktere lernt Harry nun etwas ber die Vergangenheit seiner Eltern und ich habe auch jetzt noch dasselbe Problem damit wie vor vielen Jahren Harry ist einfach nur geblendet Ja er ist dreizehn und Vollwaise das hei t ich kann mich nicht komplett in ihn hineinversetzen Aber f r ihn sind seine Eltern Heilige allen voran Daddy der ja nun wirklich das Gegenteil war Und es gibt auch gen gend Beweise und Aussagen dagegen aber das interessiert Harry gar nicht F r ihn ist Daddy der King und ich kann da ab und zu nur den Kopf sch tteln auch wenn es lustig ist wenn Harry und Snape sich deswegen anzicken Die ganze Zeitreisegeschichte zum Schluss ist dann irgendwie ich wei nicht irgendwie wirkt das auf mich nicht ganz schl ssig Zeitreisen sind so komplex und kompliziert Die ganze Zeitreise hatte n mlich absolut gar keinen Sinn Alles was die gemacht haben war ein Vieh retten Ich meine es ist ne Zeitreise und Hermine hatte den Zeitumkehrer als Modeschmuck um den Hals h ngen H tten die sich nicht f nf Minuten hinsetzen k nnen und dar ber nachdenken k nnen wie sie die Dinge gerade biegen Es passiert beim zweiten Mal alles ganz genauso wie beim ersten Mal mit dem einzigen Unterschied das Seidenschnabel gerettet wurde Das ist v llig sinnlos Man h tte sehr viel mehr machen k nnen wenn man sich mal die Zeit zum Nachdenken genommen h tte Zum Schluss muss ich noch sagen dass ich die Details absolut liebe Ja ich wiederhole mich Ich wei Aber ich liebe es wie J K Rowling alles miteinbezieht Diese ganzen Kleinigkeiten machen die B cher zu etwas Besonderem Die Tatsache dass wirklich niemand perfekt ist und auch keiner so dargestellt wird Dass trotz dem ganzen magischem Klimbim zutiefst menschliche Probleme im Vordergrund stehen Achja und eine Sache noch die mich wirklich aufgeregt hat Wieso zur H lle siezen sich Snape und Lupin Ja sie sind beide Lehrer Dass die sich vor den Sch lern siezen mag man noch verstehen auch wenn andere Lehrer sich vor den Sch lern duzen aber okay Aber die kennen sich seit sie elf Jahre alt waren Wieso siezen die sich w hrend des Showdowns in der Heulenden H tte Das ist doch eine Unterhaltung auf eher privater Ebene Feindselig und fies und beleidigend aber privat Und Sirius und Snape duzen sich ja auch Was ja auch verst ndlich ist Wieso siezen sich Snape und Lupin Boah deutsche Sprache Das ist mir fr her nie aufgefallen Aber die kennen sich seit ber zwanzig Jahren und waren schonmal beim Du wieso siezt sich man sich dann Das ist voll sinnlos und hat mich richtig gest rt beim Lesen Es ist aber sch n dass so eine Kleinigkeit mein gr tes Problem mit der Geschichte ist FazitAlles in allem ist Harry Potter und der Gefangene von Askaban ein sehr guter dritter Band Es ist nicht mehr ganz so kindisch wird langsam d sterer und die Vergangenheit verschiedener Charaktere wird n her beleuchtet Vielleicht kann man diesen Teil sogar als F llerband sehen aber er ist echt reich an Informationen Und ich liebe immer noch den trockenen Humor und die grandiosen Nebencharaktere 5 5 Sternen more"

"269","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"," May 18 2012"," Brad","really liked it"," There may be some spoilers ahead but can these books really be spoiled at this point So this time through Prisoner of Azkaban something struck me about our general pop cultural acceptance that Albus Dumbledore is the goodest of the good the best of the best the most heroic of the heroes in Rowling s world trumping even Harry because his sacrifice is genuine I am not interested in Rowling s intentions for the characters in this I am interested only in what I see And what I see tells me that only one character is good and great and heroic in the kind of goodness and greatness and heroism that interests me I am not saying that Dumbledore s a bad guy He s no Voldemort obviously although I am not entirely convinced that Voldemort is the embodiment of evil we often think of him as and he leads the battle against Voldemort s fascist rise which makes him the Churchillian leader of English myth He does sacrifice himself He does risk his health and welfare to destroy horcruxes He does protect Harry while moving the boy around like the chess piece that the boy is But what strikes me is that everything Dumbledore accomplishes is accomplished to maintain the status quo and the status quo I see is far from worthy of maintenance It is a status quo with a classic English power structure rich white guys at the top Dumbledore anyone and everyone else beneath It is a status quo with the usual class divides It is a status quo with some pretty hefty racism goblins and giants and other Others It is a status quo with institutionalized slavery and Dumbledore himself uses a small army of House Elves to run Hogwarts without a hint of distaste It is a status quo with a prison system of torture And Dumbledore does nothing to disrupt that status quo In my opinion the character who is the goodest of the good the best of the best the most heroic of the heroes is the one who rails against the status quo while simultaneously battling Voldemort and she fights Mr Riddle far more significantly than the rest of the wizarding world And she fights the status quo in spite of being mocked for her beliefs by everyone at every turn For me the paragon we should aspire to is Hermione Granger Not Dumbledore and certainly not Harry Potter So with that in mind what s not to love about Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban It is the moment that Hermione comes into her own She is the key to the resolution She keeps them all alive She s sceptical she s smart and she is potent I love Hermione Take that Hermione haters more"
"270","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"," Apr 23 2016"," Lena","it was amazing"," I solemnly swear that I am up to no good I don t know what I m doing anymore This book y all oh dear I had forgotten how much I loved Sirius dissolves into a puddle of feels When I first read this book I was 11 years old and my younger self didn t have any idea of what would be coming for her in later years Prisoner of Azkaban will always hold a special place in my heart for how it managed to captivate me so easily with only its words and my own imagination Words really are the greatest mystery What I could remember about my first read - uuhh nothing it d been more than a decade after all D What I couldn t remember For starters how could I ever forget about how Sirius ended up in that horrible prison in the first place hangs head in shame I had no fucking idea besides the stinking obvious That Peter Pettigrew the f cking traitor had framded him for a crime he never committed That s the way to not do it you goddamn cunt bears teeth I almost compleley forgot about the chapters in the Shrieking Shack and the way Lupin s best friends trained to become Animagi so that they were able to keep him company while he was a in werewolf form WHAAAAAAAAAT On top of that I had no idea why Snape was such a bitch to Lupin until after the latter had told his story Honestly that entire scene was gold I also didn t know that James animagi form was a stag since we all know that Harry s Patronus takes form of said animal Ronald Weasley is one of the most underrated characters in the movies and now that I ve re-read the first three books it becomes that much more obvious Radically speaking they turned him into a clown which makes me angry because some of the lines Hermione said in the movies originally belonged to him ARRGHH I don t like comparing books to their movie pals as I see them as two entirely different sources but this had to be said Period Harry is the sweetest muffin and most of the time I have the urge to give him bone-crushing hugs and feed him cookies This precious boy must be protected at all costs I m not distressed I m trying to tell them what happened Harry said furiously If they d just listen- But Madam Pomfrey suddenly stuffed a large chunk of chocolate into Harry s mouth He choked and she seized the opportunity to force him back onto the bed Or do it like Madam Pomfrey xDI AM LIVING FOR THIS RE-READ more"
