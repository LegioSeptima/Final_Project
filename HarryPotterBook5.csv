"5","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Mar 13 2013"," Navessa","it was amazing"," Seriously don t read this review if you haven t read the books The biggest compliment I can think to give an 870 page book is that I wish it had been longer I wish this had been longer This book has always been my favorite in the series Up until it Harry s story had been filled with light Sure there were some tough parts earlier on and while it s true that some darkness crept into the ending of the previous installment for the most part that was a pretty happy book compared to this Ron got over his jealousy the school eventually got behind Harry as a Champion and good still triumphed over evil Our hero surmounted impossible odds in the Triwizard Tournament and then managed to escape Voldemort yet again and warn the wizarding world of his return And then BAM The beginning of this book hits you in the face Where you expect Harry to be in the know he s in the dark where you expect The Daily Prophet to be filled with stories about the ministry pursuing Voldemort there s only silence where you expect excitement about returning to Hogwarts there is only frustration and angst And you know what You get it you frigging get it man Because you were with Harry when he faced Voldemort and his Death Eaters alone you stood beside him as the shades of his parents appeared from the tip of his enemy s wand and helped save his life And when he made it back to safety you were just as dumbfounded as he was when the minister of magic refused to believe him refused to believe Dumbledore So how dare they How dare they let him rot alone in a house full of people who hate and ridicule him while the murderer of his parents begins to rebuild his army How dare they feed him snippets like We can t tell you anything about what we ve been doing and we ve been doing A LOT But don t worry we ll see you soon we just can t tell you when As if he hasn t been through enough If anyone has the right to know what s going on it s Harry Doesn t anyone KNOW him like we do Or do they just think that they know what s best for him better than he does And that s part of the genius of this installment This book grows up Where the previous four could be labeled as children s stories this one cannot There are so many hard lessons and difficult themes in this ones that a child s mind cannot fully grasp Gone are the heroes gone are the happy endings This book teaches you that adults aren t the perfect protectors you thought they were Sirius isn t infallible James Potter isn t infallible Albus frigging Dumbledore isn t infallible None of them are None of them are even fully good And come to find out those you thought were fully evil might not be either This book introduces you to shades of grey and each revelation seems to hit you harder than the last Normally I hate angst This is mostly because I find the vast majority of what I see these days to be a sorry excuse to lengthen a story or a shoddy attempt to distract a reader from glaring issues Trying to cover up weak characterization Add some angst Want to hide those holes in your plot Add some angst The only type of angst I can stand is believable angst Rowling delivers on this And that s one of the many reasons that I love this book There are a lot of other reasons Fred and George s badassery Ginny Weasley finding her voice and becoming a character in her own right the undiluted rage that coursed through my body every time I read a scene that included Delores Umbridge the incredible courage and honesty of Hermione Granger the loyalty of Ron Weasley Neville Longbottom coming into his own the failed Occlumency lessons I WILL ALWAYS HATE SNAPE and the way the entire school ended up doing exactly what the sorting hat suggested at the beginning of the year and banded together as one against the ministry s interference I even loved the ending YES I SAID IT And do you know why Because life isn t sunshine and roses and you don t always get to say goodbye to those you love You don t get the sense that Sirius s death was a righteous one You don t get resolution He didn t make some grand sacrifice to save the lives of many others He died taunting the bad guys smiling at them egging them on as though he was still that ego-inflated teenager you glimpsed through the pensieve And then you find out that it was all for nothing That there were so many ways that it could have been avoided How do you deal with that The best you can I guess So while I don t necessarily enjoy this book as much as I do the others it remains my favorite in the series for the reasons I listed above "
"6","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Jul 01 2008"," Jessika","it was amazing"," I cried like a little baby J K Rowling really starts taking the series down a darker road in this book She is so talented at character development and it really shines in this book Here Harry is 15 years old and for most of the book he s whiny and self-centered just like a typical teenager I also adore Dumbledore s role in this book--his conversation at the end with Harry put me to tears Rowling did an amazing job with the character of Umbridge never have I hated a fictional character more than I hated her I do have to admit I m curious to see whether she makes any more appearances or not For me this book was stronger for character development than plot Yes this is a key book for the series but I felt like most of the book was spent with characters internal issues and development rather than the plot I love how Harry and the crew are dealing with more adult issues now such as relationships and death As with all of her books I have a really difficult time putting these books down but especially within the last 100 pages I physically could not separate the book from my hands Overall another outstanding addition from J K Rowling more"

"8","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Jun 26 2010"," Raeleen Lemay","it was amazing"," Re-Read in December 2014 for Harry Christmas To Youok I will start by saying that this is one of my least favorite books in the series and that isn t because it s bad BECAUSE IT IS DEFINITELY NOT It s mainly due to the fact that I hate Umbridge more than words can translate and having to read about her so much just infuriates me rather than giving me warm fuzzies the entire time I m reading That being said here are some of my thoughts on the book -mention of Regulus Black near the beginning of this book I ve noticed particularly during this re-read that J K Rowling tends to mention characters a book or two before they will have any importance to the story She seriously knew what she was doing while writing these books -it s so weird to think that Sirius is related to Narcissa and Bellatrix Sirius is such an amazing human and he was born into a terrible family which is pretty true of a lot of people Just because you come from something somewhere terrible that doesn t mean you can t be different and be good -Ron and Hermione becoming prefects is just so great Surely there would be a better candidate in their year to be the male prefect yet Dumbledore chose Ron Why Because Dumbledore knows that Ron always feels worthless in comparison to his five older brothers and him becoming prefect was enough to make him feel like a winner at something Dumbledore is cool like that -Quite often I forget that St Mungo s exists since it s not in the movies at all Here we get to see Neville s parents as well as Gilderoy Lockhart who is adorable now and not at all annoying and I WISH THAT WAS IN THE MOVIES -it sucks that Harry was banned from playing Quidditch this year as I LOVE Quidditch and Harry was so sad because of it which made him cranky and quite insane HOWEVER I love that Ginny took over for him as Seeker I feel like Ginny has grown up so much already and it s particularly in this book that I grew to really like her She s so much better in the books than in the movies -In the epic fight near the end of the book NEVILLE IS SO BADASS If you ever think that Neville isn t brave until the last book you are wrong He was throwing himself at Death Eaters and Stunning the shit out of everybody It was awesome -As usual lots of information was revealed in the last couple of chapters of the book This particular book reveals A LOT of stuff that most people were probably wondering about whilst reading the other four books as well as information that you probably didn t even think of I love how many answers we get in this one I THINK THAT S IT FOR NOW I have a lot of feelings so I might add more later more"

"13","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Oct 01 2015"," Mikee Andrea ReadWithMikee","really liked it"," Things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end if not always in the way we expect Rating I feel like I m going to get attacked for only rating a Harry Potter book 3 75 stars but Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is probably my LEAST favorite of the series thus far It went by so slow and I felt like too much went on but at the same time nothing really happened This book could ve easily been made at least 200 pages shorter if J K Rowling got rid of all the pointless details and chapters that added nothing significant to the storyline The movie was never really one of my favorites either and that was probably the primary reason it took me more than a month to get through Order of the Phoenix On top of that I wasn t a big fan of Harry in this book I understand that he went through a whole lot after the events of Goblet of Fire but he was moody and a jerk to everyone around him 98 of the time and although I can empathize with him it became too over the top for me and I got tired of it real fast He just kept snapping and going off on all the wrong people and it got really annoying All the constant CAPITALIZED yelling didn t help too much either Even though Order of the Phoenix was my least favorite movie and book I LOVED the concept of Dumbledore s Army I just loved seeing all the students in action and actually putting everything they learned into good use We finally get to meet Luna Lovegood one of my favorite Harry Potter characters of all time and I was so ecstatic every time her name was mentioned As for Umbridge she was also the ultimate villain in this book She was the woman you LOVED to HATE and I felt the movie nailed this portrayal so perfectly If J K Rowling s goal was to make you want to rip your own hair to shreds she succeeded that and more Overall I felt the book was unnecessarily long but the movie itself was not much better Where the book felt too slow the film adaptation felt too rushed leaving out key details Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix will probably always be my least favorite book and movie in the series but the worst Harry Potter book is still a whole league better than a lot of other books more"
"14","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Apr 29 2014"," Bookdragon Sean","it was amazing"," Despite this being the longest book in the series I read it quicker than all the others Here s three things I really loved about it 1 Harry and Sirius- they never had much time together but the time they did have really influenced Harry s development a few wise words from a sincere friend or godfather can go a real long way And this scene was perhaps the most powerfully written in the series for me we all know what happens next 2 Dumbledore s Army- Harry Ron and Hermione have always taken matters into their own hands they ve never waited for someone to come along and save them And here they have got so many great characters involved in their heroics which leads me onto my next point 3 Luna Lovegood- because the weird people are always the best people Luna s by far my favourite character because she is so completely herself in all her colourfulness she s often ignored avoided and even ridiculed as a result but secretly she is brilliant The world needs more Luna Lovegoods I always thought she had far more chemistry with Harry than Ginny ever did more"

"17","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Jan 20 2014"," C G Drews","liked it"," AHHHH I AM FINALLY FINISHD collapses in a puddle Peoples I usually read a book in a day two days if it s big three if it s super huge THIS BOOK TOOK ME FOREVER I know there a lot of super-keen Potter fans out there so um you may not want to read this review But But WAIT The biggest thing you need to know is I seriously love this series I do It s so detailed and thorough and interesting and I totally see why it s captured the world in it s wizarding claws BUT I didn t grow up reading it And now Reading it I love a lot of things but there are so many things that bother me particularly about The Order of the Phoenix THINGS THAT BOTHERED ME The freaking gargantuan size This is the most important thing to note IT IS HUGE AND IT SHOULD NOT BE THIS BIG The first 100-pages are numbingly boring they cleaned house SO WHAT Ron Hermione s bickering drove me nuts This trio of friends act so often NOT like friends it just really grates on me I know friends have their ups and downs but Ron is downright rude Harry is usually oblivious but he doesn t help things much either Of COURSE I m Team Hermione here and I know she gets together with Ron but I ain t shipping it The last 50-pages were so intense and interesting WHY WERE THEY SO SHORT It s like the book FINALLY warmed up and got going and got exciting and -- BOOM -- it s done now Plus so many interest reveals just come as a Dumbledore info-dump Um Seriously The characters in general drove me nuts I love Dumbledore don t get me wrong but he s awfully passive There s this whole attitude around like Awww well nothing TOO BAD is going badly so let s just wait until it gets absolutely horrific before we do anything shall we AND ARGHHH YOU STUIPD STUPID WIZARDS And Harry s logic I mean lack thereof was frustrating Like Omg a teacher is physically abusing me I won t tell I m a strong brave little melon NO YOU RE A FREAKING IDIOT Harry s whole mantra of just suffering in silence made me so so angry Snape Because it s a grand idea to have a teacher who abuses and bullies students because he had a crappy childhood Solid work hiring him Dumbledore I HATE SNAPE BTW In general the book s huge GARGANTUAN themes of injustice This one is very very much me but social injustice and discrimination against children and adults exercising their age as a way to control lord over younger humans -- I HATE IT WITH THE FIRE AND PASSION OF A THOUSAND SUNS Sure yes it has it s place in books It s realistic But every time I pick up a Potter book I just get smothered with how unjust everything is and it makes me SO ANGRY And while there are 2 dozen things I love about these books THAT is what makes me wait like 9 million years between picking up volumes There should be more balance There should be more fighting back instead of passiveness And please someone remind me why Harry still needs to live with the Dursley s Because I think we ve established he doesn t Another injustice for no reason OKAAAAY BUT YOU GUYS PROBABLY THINK I HATE HARRY POTTER NOW AND IT S NOT TRUE I also have a list of things I freaking loved And at the end of the day I do like this series I don t adore it like a true Potterhead I spose But I do enjoy it THINGS I ABSOLUTELY LOVE The detail okay I do complain that the books are too big they are but I have to admit this makes the worlds SO INCREDIBLE DEEP Like all the food details the off-handed comments the descriptions the subjects IT S INSANELY AWESOME It s not like reading about a bunch of kids going to school it s like genuinely being there The fact that they actually had to DO SCHOOLWORK So often I read books about characters who are not geniuses but still manage to save the world AND score uber well in school without doing a scrap of homework NO So I love that Harry Potter makes them save the world AND do their homework And half the time I think their homework sounds freakishy fascinating Yes I m having a Hermione moment HERMIONE I ABSOLUTELY LOVE HER She is like one of the biggest reasons I love this series and would even consider rereading seriously I just said that Even though I complain I d like to try audios one day because she s smart and into equality and rights and I just love her yes okay oh and McGongall I love her too SO SO MUCH She does not take a single piece of crap from anyone SHE IS AMAZING I love how she fought Umbridge although I think she could ve done more like stabbed Umbridge in the eye or something and I love how she s fiercely protective of her students She s like a super scary mum The Weasleys ALL OF THEM Even Ginny is getting more a personality now YAAAY I particularly love Fred and George and I m glad they re living their dream Oh but obviously I hate Percy Ron is not my favourite person unfortunately because I think he s very self-obsessed and I do find him irritating at times BUUUUT MRS WEASLEY IS SO FEIRCE AND WONDERFUL Also Luna although I wish she had a bigger part Maybe she will in future books I love her and her whimsical attitude She s totally fascinating And Neville is amazing I particularly love how when Harry was teaching the secret Dark Arts class how Neville was just THRIVING He didn t feel threatened and he had one-on-one help with a peer he likes and respect EQUALS HIM DOING SO WELL YAY I feel so so annoyed at this book too because I feel Neville has a learning disability and everyone just ignores it Some teachers do a bit more but mostly he gets abused - by teachers and students alike I knoooow stuff like that happens IRL But we re not reading real life are we We re reading about a WIZARD school and I ll be damned if I don t sit here and demand things like learning disabilities should be given respect and help I love Neville KEEP FIGHTING NEVILLE And no matter how much I complain I actually lost track of time while reading this That s right I was reading and my eyes were burning at night and I was like OMG WHAT S THE TIME so I totally read a lot later than I would usually A book that absorbs me is definitely a good book SEE I DO LIKE IT Mostly I hated Umbridge of course but duh Who doesn t Ultimately it was too big and I got a wrist sprain just holding the jolly hardback BUT It s intense and magical and intriguing and I want to know what happens next Also I want to see the movies more"

"20","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Jun 28 2007"," Annie","did not like it"," hrrmmpp This is my least favourite of the Harry Potter series and almost borders on the don t bother It is saved only by the virtue that it is a Harry Potter book and moves the series along to the still yet unknown finale My issues with it - deals with complex social political problems in a simplified extreme and dichotomous manner- characterisations are too easy lazy- all good or all bad with the exception of Snape who s good evil intentions are yet unknown all courageous or cowardly the righteous or the corrupt - Malfoy junior is the most incompetent nemesis in the history of evil And whilst this was acceptable in the earlier books where there was an element of the comical in his attempts to be evil by book 5 where the themes have become signifantly darker he and his side-kicks unchanging and inane attempts to foil Harry s ultimate fate have just become annoying The only saving grace is that Harry has more than enough true and worthwhile enemies and obstacles for the reader to really get bogged down by Malfoy s silliness - the laudable themes of power corruption propaganda censorship are played out with such naive characterisations extreme situations and melodramaticism that it results in inflammatory knee-jerk reactions rather than furthering understanding of the subleties of these ideas - the plot seems confused as if JK Rowling has all these ideas but is unsure of where she ultimately wants to go thereby leaving in all these subplots that neither has entertainment wisdom nor story-advancing value EG what s with Grawp and the freaking giants Overall- read it only as a part of the greater goal of coming closer to the ending of the series more"
"21","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Jun 22 2012"," Nour Sharif","it was amazing"," Edit 3 27 3 2015 I am still getting positive feedback over this and every time I read what you guys and girls have told me my heart swells Gosh I am so proud of this review Edit 2 25\7\2014So I came across this article today and for some reason it made me happy I feel evil evil laugh http mea-news net en index php 2014 Edit 1 8\3\2014It has been four months that I posted this review And so far I have received great feedback Thank you everyone for yo ur support Remember this is not a benign cause 6 11 2013I know that I have neglected the subject of the new Goodreads policy a lot recently and I ought not to have done that You see I wasn t very free recently and well because I didn t know what to either say or on what book should I post it And then I read this book and the rebelliousness in this book made me think that hey this book is perfect for what I have in mind Oh and guess what I am going to be aggressive Let me tell you something maybe a lot of you people are not aware of We people who live in the Middle East look up towards the west where presumably everyone is free to say and do whatever they want bounded by no tradition or religious law whatsoever But when this kind of law is forced upon everyone from the west itself we lose hope We lose hope that anything will be good again And well for someone me who has suffered a lot because of that Facebook only made my freedom of speech more restricted I found a haven for myself in Goodreads where apparently no one gives a damn whether you insult or disagree with them because well they don t care And because they are mature enough to ignore any insults under the pretext that it is your opinion Do you know how much I love that I have suffered A LOT because of that Let me tell you something about myself I never EVER stay quiet about something that I believe to be true even if I was wrong to many other people and now Mister Money-Head-Of-Amazon has to ruin that for me All right I realized that everything that was said about the new policy was said in the utmost civilized way But guess what I am a teenager I don t give a damn about manners and I am about to say what everyone has wanted to say for a long time Goodreads by succumbing to the green papers have restricted my freedom of speech In the last few years I have been bullied put down humiliated insulted punished just because I wanted to say what I had in mind just because I always stand up to what I believe in And since because ALL OF THAT HAPPENED TO ME I turned towards Goodreads where I was surprised that no one cared about whatever I said and always respected me when I wanted to express myself No review of mine has been removed but a lot of people s reviews have been removed Since it didn t affect me yet I should shut up right No Just the fact that it exists is bothering me It is like having this law around forbidding people to eat chicken and I hate chicken but that doesn t mean I should keep quiet Okay that was a bad example but the closest I had to the ridiculousness of what we are fighting for No one should fight for his right to express himself freely It is a right We are born with that right And no number of reviews removed is going to change that It is not going to frighten us It is not going to make us back out You can remove all the reviews you want Goodreads but this is something I believe in So I am fighting even if you have to ban me Well according to your own policy you can t do that Well you can t even remove the reviews that have been put before the declaration of that censorship but you do it anyway So you are bunch of hypocrites You Goodreads managers anyone with the IQ of a peacock can realize that what you have done is so wrong on so many levels If I were the Goodreads manager I would say this to the Amazon Manager when he came offering the new law You can take your money and your pathetic ass out of my office You cannot threaten us with money or hold it over our heads This company has so far made you millions of money just by existing and promoting your books More than half of our members buy regularly from your website In fact according to this logic you owe us GR Manager slaps Amazon Manager Jackie Shan bursts into the scene wearing nothing but a newspaper around his waist Kung fu Jackie kicks Amazon Manager s head off and his body goes around looking for its head Meanwhile GR Manager holds both the head and the body and throws them from the window of the headquarters BOOM The end This policy is so wrong If people like us cannot express themselves online then where will they I might not insult your precious little authors Amazon Manager in my opinion they shouldn t be called authors if they can t take god damn criticism Not everyone should approve with them but I have every god damn right to express myself freely without having to worry whether my review would be removed or not The management even has no right to go around reading whatever we say online because well I thought they had better things to do It turns out I was wrong don t you think Anyway what we say online is OUR concern not yours You shouldn t threaten us You shouldn t condemn us Maybe to you you are only deleting a review but to us you are restricting our freedom And no one really appreciates freedom but the ones who have been deprived from it I wonder how the Goodreads Management even agreed to this I had a lot more to say about this on my mind but I think I have made my point quite clearly Us readers and the ones who write a bit like I do find words our strongest weapon Back to my review about this book THIS WAS THE WORST BOOK I HAVE READ I have cried 50 pages straight view spoiler why did she have to kill Sirius WHAT DID HE EVER DO TO HER I AM STILL CRYING YOU KNOW hide spoiler The 5 stars I have given it it was not a WOW I LOVED THIS BOOK AUTOMATIC FIVE STARS No It was this kind of books it deserves 5 stars with a little dash of wow at the end This is the kind of perfect books that makes you feel as though all happiness innocence and hope had been sucked out of the world and until everything in the book is fixed nothing in the world will ever be right again I have really a lot of controversial feelings about this book but it all goes down to one point It is good It is worthy of five stars And it had hooked me up five days straight more"
"22","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Mar 20 2018"," Luffy","it was amazing"," Among the last 3 books in the Harry Potter series this is the one that I respect the most It s not without its fault But naming the faults will not advance anything especially for people who are fans Albus Dumbledore really gets a lot of focus He does the kind of things that really bring a lump to the throat Because of him I ve never really regretted rereading this book oh so many times Harry s Godfather also gets his time to shine Books 3 and 5 showcase his ability and motivation clearly I never thought rereading book 6 would be a good idea so reading Harry Potter probably ends here as far as Goodreads is concerned more"

I think it was brilliant idea said harry coldly Cho flushed and her eyes grew brighter Oh yes I forgot - of course if it was darling Hermione s idea - Don t start crying again said Harry warningly I wasn t going to she shouted Yeah well good he said I ve got enough to cop with at the moment Go and cope with it then Cho said furiously turning on her heel and stalking off Yeah said Ron slowly savouring the words we won Did you see the look on Cho s face when Ginny got the snitch right out from under her nose I suppose she cried did she said Harry bitterly Well yeah - more out of temper than anything though Ron frowned slightly But you saw her chuck her broom away when she got back to the ground didn t you and she was totally insane why did she have to ask about Cedric to Harry while they were dating of course Harry didn t want to talk abou Cedric and Didn t she have feelings I m sure Harry didn t want to remember that horrible memory I ship Harry with Ginny because Ginny is funny Ginny is not a crybaby Ginny is brave Ginny is more beautiful than Cho She is basically more perfect than Cho I Don t Like Harry s Temper I know Harry was having a hard time but that didn t mean he had the rights to be harsh to his best friends they will always on his side and there was a scene where he snapped at Hermione Been having a nice little chat with her about whether or not I m a lying attention-seeking prat have you Harry said loudly No said Hermione calmly I told her to keep her big fat mouth shut about you actually And it would be quite nice if you stopped jumping down our throats Harry because in case you haven t noticed Ron and I are on your side There was a short pause Sorry said Harry in a low voice That s quite all right said Hermione with dignity Then she shook her head Don t you remember what Dumbledore said at the last end-of-term feast and they continued talking oh I also didn t like Harry when he shouted at professor Dumbledore because he just saved his life and he s clearly older than Harry So Harry had to talk calmly to him even though he was angry and the most annoying thing was that he destroyed Dumbledore s possessions he was totally rudeI know I know he was sad because Sirius just died and I was sad too I cried a lot but I didn t angry with Dumbledore I was angry with Kreacher Bellatrix and Voldemort I still am actually how could I forgive them they killed Sirius I Love Sirius Especially Young Sirius With another shock of excitement Harry saw Sirius give James the thumbs-up Sirius was lounging in his chair at ease tilting it back on two legs He was very good-looking his dark hair fell into his eyes with a sort of casual elegance neither James s nor Harry s could ever have achieved and a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully though he didn t seem to have noticed OH MY GOD HE IS SO HANDSOME BUT WHY WHY DID HE HAVE TO DIE I LIKE SIRIUS SO MUCH AND NOW I WILL NEVER SEE HIM ANYMORE LIFE IS SO UNFAIR thank you for reading and liking this review guys hope you guys have a great day P S I like Luna so much she is funny xD more"

"31","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Jul 04 2016"," Councillor","it was amazing"," A lot of people consider The Order of the Phoenix to be the weakest book in the entire Harry Potter series I haven t read the last two installments yet but from what I have read so far this one was my favorite I enjoyed two other books in the series more than this one The Sorcerer s Stone and The Goblet of Fire but enjoyment is not necessarily the only aspect allowing a book to turn into a favorite Let s go on the dark side here While the previous books were still light-hearted in the overall atmosphere in spite of certain parts of the storylines this one consisted to approximately 95 of darkness and a lack of happiness for all the characters involved Studying at Hogwarts is not enjoyable anymore life has become dangerous for everyone everywhere favorite teachers have been replaced by unlikeable ones dangers and traps are looming wherever you set your feet Life is not easy for Harry Potter and his friends in this book because not only do the dangers floating above their heads cloud their moods - they also slowly enter puberty with all the feelings and emotions involved with the process of growing-up Not only because of the darkness of the various themes but also due to the character development is it impossible to call this book a children s book anymore Justice is what a lot of readers - including myself - probably missed in this book Harry has won the Triwizard Tournament but nobody truly acknowledges his victory He still has to spend the summer with his merciless family he still has to fight for his reputation and his dignity After everything Harry achieved life reveals itself to him in its cruelest colors the Dark Lord s return only being one of the many aspects influencing his decline of happiness This book also introduces one of the most despised characters in the Harry Potter universe Dolores Jane Umbridge Who could possibly like such a woman Apart from imagining Imelda Staunton s inspiring portrayal from the movies which helped a lot with exploring Dolores role in the book her unforgiving decisions and her unforgettable appearances it can be discussed whether Dolores Umbridge is truly a realistic character but she supported J K Rowling s general direction into the dark themes of the series and if there is one thing Dolores Umbridge s presence was good for then it is this It made Harry and his friends but also the book s readers realize that life is never the way you imagine it to be Life is cruel life is hard life is merciless I love this book because it doesn t beautify things Death is presented as a necessary part of everyone s life All the characters are created as human beings who are full of faults and mistakes The perfect images everyone had in their minds of characters like Albus Dumbledore James Potter or even Sirius Black are shattered in the course of the book only to allow the readers to form new opinions on those characters again Those books are set in the fantasy genre but it all felt so realistic that it was impossible not to share the thrill and the excitement of those pages - mainly because the characters felt so realistic They are flawed They are full of emotions They come to decisions and they regret decisions But in their essence they are human Which is perhaps why so many readers love this series - because it feels like you accompany people into a completely different world who might as well be your friends who are sitting at your school desk next to you Major spoiler for this novel view spoiler I am not even angry with J K Rowling for killing off Sirius Black Obviously he was a character beloved by a lot of readers and I would have loved to see Sirius being redeemed officially as not having committed the crimes he was accused of But that s the very reason for why this is my favorite novel in the series so far Just like in real life it s not a given that the good people survive and the bad people die You can t even always say who is good and who is evil because there is a thin line because good and bad hide spoiler A lot of fantasy authors tend to kill off the antagonists and create a happy ending with the good-hearted major characters which is my main reason for my troubles with the fantasy genre J K Rowling doesn t mind all this with her novels you never know who is going to survive and who is going to die because it could be everyone As long as you haven t been spoiled already that is Yes maybe this book is too long indeed I needed more days to finish it than I needed for all the other four books combined considering only the respective reading time I spent with them Yes maybe it could be shortened although I am the last one who knows how that could possibly be done Yes it is darker than all the other books in the series so far And yes I loved it for all those reasons Things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end if not always in the way we expect -----------Pre-Review 4th July It has been three months since I finished Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and only now do I finally begin reading this fifth book in the series Which I am reading for the first time Can this confession become even more embarassing Maybe it can be accepted as an explanation that I left the fourth book feeling like this and obviously needing to recuperate So let s continue my journey through the world of Hogwarts Review to come once I m finished Which might take a while because while it s evidently Harry Potter and shouldn t take much time to get through my copy of this book has 1040 pages That s loooong And of course a pretty good thing considering that it s Harry Potter we talk about My reviews in the Harry Potter series 1 Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone Go to review2 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Go to review3 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Go to review4 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Go to review more"

"36","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," May 24 2007"," J G Keely","liked it"," This is my favorite installment of the quintessential modern bildungsroman Nevertheless it has its problems familiar to any reader of Rowling s She never seems to gain control of her writing which spirals out into thousand-page doorstops filled with unimportant side characters and rambling plots The story is moved along by arbitrary plot devices often magic Instead of using the magic to make her world seem more strange and wondrous she uses it to cover up plot holes Why write a consistent plot when you can just put in a spell or two to fix the problems Likewise her world is poorly defined She did not start by constructing the wizarding world and then base her stories off of it rather she changes her setting to fit whatever she needs at the moment This constantly shifting setting means the world doesn t make much sense if you take the time to sit and think about it Her fractured plots are not the result of realism which some authors use to create a sense of a real world separate from archetypes Rowling is just trying to fit in all the disparate ideas and characters she has in her notepad She becomes so attached to her characters and ideas that she is unwilling to sacrifice them for a more streamlined book She has problems connecting the many dots of her story but uses her magical plot devices to keep us from noticing that the scaffolding behind the facade is rather bare indeed crumbly Her rabid plot movement points away from the cracks in her storytelling move along nothing to see here I find it somewhat ironic that Rowling wants to graduate from Potter to writing adult mysteries A mystery needs to have a tight plot based not in the characters but in the events surrounding them Though many people tried to figure out the Potter books and predict them in truth there is nothing to figure out Rowling s foreshadowing is vague and unsupported and there are just as many clues as red herrings The only reason some of the elements seem predictable is because there was a crack team of several million people making every guess under the sun Combine that with the fact that the final book introduces completely new elements to finish the plot and we can see that Rowling is not really in charge of her own pen She is a slave to her own sentimentality Then again so are millions around the world The only thing which makes these meandering plots move along at a reasonable pace are her characters They connect us to the magical world so that even if it doesn t make sense at least we can see how it might work for the people who live in it Her characters are vivid emotional motivated and archetypal without being banal They may not be psychologically deep but for a monomyth like this that is hardly the point Most people aren t that complex either In the series this book gets the prize for the most psychological depth and also the most consistent mood Before this Rowling was still trying to get her footing figuring out what exactly she was writing and trying to explain the world to her readers She finally hit her stride in Prisoner of Azkaban and got much of her unsure world-building out of the way in Goblet of Fire This is before she started feeling the pressure to wrap things up in a neat package which again begins to take its toll on her consistency This is the first and really the last of her books where Rowling is able to write without being overly concerned with either the beginning or ending of her series Instead of placing a scattered plot over her characters Rowling was instead able to let the characters travel through their own path of growth and self-exploration The change is the most apparent in Harry himself and though his transformation is somewhat sudden it is still honest and believable for the character By focusing chiefly on her strength--character building--and escaping the constraints of the monomyth if only for a moment Rowling is able to avoid her weakest points as a writer and turn out her strongest book My Fantasy Book Suggestions more"

"38","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Jul 31 2012"," Evgeny","really liked it"," Harry Potter s fifth year at Hogwarts The One Who Shall Not Be Named gathers power but Harry Potter is completely sheltered from outside world and as the result has no clue about what Lord Voldemort is up to This leads to frustration which in turn leads to angst Speaking of the latter the book is full of it So as I was saying Harry is full of angst through the whole book This makes for slow moving plot sometimes It does not help any that the book is probably the biggest in the series To Harry s defense he has a pretty good reason for being such A couple of reasons actually Firstly he is a 15-year-old boy in here Remember 15-year-old yourself You were full of angst too Secondly Dumbledore failed Harry hard In fact he keep failing him over and over again until the last couple of chapters The biggest lesson of it all the adults can be wrong as an adult it pains me to say it even the ones you hold in the greatest respect like it is a case with Harry and Dumbledore I do not think my review would be complete without mentioning the following character This is how I envision her the movie version was pretty good too I am talking about Dolores Umbridge of cause Compared to Lord Voldemort she is fairly low-level as far as villains go but she was created in such a way that everybody and their brother love to hate her So this is the first book of the series which gets less than perfect rating The main reason is I feel that it could be made shorter - but I ll be damned if I know how It is still great and everything but 600 pages are a little bit too much for a Harry Potter tale especially the angst-y one more"

"40","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Mar 10 2012"," TS","it was amazing"," 5th reread - 02 11 2017 Things I love about this book - although it s one of the darker and sadder books in the series it s also arguably the funniest one - McGonagall s sass- Hermione s sass- Harry s sass like yeah he s especially angsty in this one but he s also sassy as hell - Everybody s sass towards Umbridge basically- Give them hell Peeves - Fred George Weasley - although detestable Umbridge is arguably the best villain in literary history only because she is so realistic in her portrayal and her totalitarianism and fascism and cruelty towards people who are unlike her or don t agree with her is something that you could easily find in people irl in position of power and that s terrifying- Thestrals even though the fact that HP couldn t see them since year 1 is a major loophole - my unfeeling heart sobbing because of feels towards the end- learning about Black s family tree- Bellatrix - WEASLEY IS OUR KING- Luna Lovegood is the most precious human being ever ever ever ever ever - Harry s loss and Luna being the only one able to console him of that loss- Dumbledore shedding a tear and finally seeming human instead of this great omnipotent untouchable perhaps sometimes quirky wizard although he s that too but it s nice to see the vulnerability - the magical implications of The Room of Requirement - all the answers we re given by Dumbledore finally ----------------I don t even need to review this one because anyone who has even the least bit of decency in them knows that the Harry Potter books are the BEST SERIES OF ALL TIME Period The end No buts more"
"41","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Mar 26 2013"," Bradley","it was amazing"," Wow I can tell you that on a re-read this story really stands out as both a very dark turn and a wonderfully complex story Why is my memory so poor you ask Because while I remember it being this good when I first read it I ve only had the altered perceptions of the movie to go by ever since And that is a MISTAKE I should have known Short movies like that can t do real justice to heavy heavy tomes like this novel Notably missing the TWINS Sure they get their big time to shine in the movie but they don t get the backstory of where they got their money or the sheer amount of legwork and field-testing for their jokes right on Hogwarts grounds So delicious Also missing an actually delightful Dobby I can t believe how much knitting Hermione went through on her quest to free all the house elves and only Dobby was willing to take her clothing all to save her feelings How Sweet Also missing long explanations and carefully constructed dream-plots and traps that make complete sense unlike that mess we saw in the movie that just kinda slaps us in a direction and lets us be surprised Hey Look where we are and we re fighting Sheesh All I can say is Bravo Volemort Yours was actually a pretty good plan even if you re missing a certain piece of intelligence All told I can honestly say that I liked this one better than all the rest up to this point There s not so much flash and dash as all the rest except with the blowout battle with the Deatheaters and Voldemort and Dumbledore at the end but there is way more than enough conflict and rising tension for three lesser books We all know this is a dark story with Dolores What fantastic fun more"
"42","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Jul 17 2016"," Markus","really liked it"," It s settled The fifth Harry Potter book has worked a miracle I actually like the Harry Potter series You hear that I actually like it The first three books were silly children s books with the occasional really good part Enjoyable but hardly remarkable The fourth was an excruciatingly boring book that was saved by its amazing ending Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix on the other hand is a great fantasy novel The atmosphere is finally a lot darker the story is a lot more coherent and several new characters organisations places and scenes add a lot of complexity One of the most important aspects is the expansion of Severus Snape s character One particular flashback made me understand all his actions though not quite like him at least not yet and hate Harry s sorry excuse for a father more than any literary character ever The wildly interesting Order of the Phoenix is obviously introduced several of Sirius ancestors show up in various forms including the absodamnlutely amazing Phineas Nigellus Black Dumbledore is truly shining in this instalment and the final scenes in the Department of Mysteries top the whole thing off greatly All in all the second half of the series has placed itself on a much higher level than the first and I am fully immersed in it for the first time more"

"44","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Mar 10 2016"," Brina","really liked it"," I have read the Harry Potter septuology in its entirety at least ten times This book is the turning point and also the most difficult for me to read For starters I detest Umbrage that foul woman In fact I abhor her to the point that on occasion I have skipped from book 4 to 6 just to avoid her Order of the Phoenix is a whopping 870 pages J K Rowling s prose has transformed from being geared toward kids to teenagers mirroring Harry s own development In books 1-4 the language is easy enough that despite the length even middle grade kids should be able to read it Book 5 is more tedious The themes are darker and tougher to digest Additionally the students are interested in dating making the content slightly inappropriate for younger readers Prose aside we see new characters and many developments in the plot lines We witness how powerful Dumbledore s abilities are the clear distinctions between Voldemort s death eaters and Dumbledore s army The end makes it challenging for me to finish the entire book even after all these times because I know what is coming Looking forward to books 6 and 7 which I enjoy much more than this one more"

"50","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Mar 12 2018"," Beth","really liked it"," 4 5 Stars Hem Hem Where to even begin with this book My god it was long that s the first thing I have to say I understand why it s as bis as what it is because it s introducing new characters setting the scene going into more depth with other characters but honestly some of it wasn t really necessary my main example was the cleaning of the house Now moving on I love that it s getting darker and the story is really really coming along we re getting more answers on what is going to happen there s so much more time in school with the learning aspect and DA meetings which was so exciting to see Now I know lots of people know and love these characters and I don t normally do a character section because people know them but I have to mention just a few because I would put it under my likes and what not but this needs its own bit Firstly I m going to come out and say it I adored Neville in these books we really see him come into his own especially in regards to the DA meetings we see him thrive in something Throughout other books he comes across as someone who isn t seen to be really special and not very good at things however in this My god I felt SO proud I think what was important is that people actually found out what happened to his parents and because no one reacted to that he took it in his stride and actually did something about it He stood up for Harry when others were being cruel to him and he refused to take no for an answer He was one of the last two standing He needs MORE appreciation Then we have Professor McGonagall I already loved her as a character but in this boy I loved her even more She took no nonsense from Umbridge she was there to support others she s loyal and if you re on her bad side well The protectiveness she has for her students and Dumbledore Ahhh my heart This time around I wasn t as keen on Harry to begin with Like don t get me wrong I know he s been through a lot but he was just so angry all of the time like I said I know why but it was sometimes just too much He was fighting with anyone who tried to help the backwards and forwards with Cho didn t really do anything for me either However towards the end he got much better and as The Chosen One he took it in his stride and realisation has set in so I look forward to seeing how he progresses throughout LONG LIVE FRED AND GEORGE they are 100000000 my favourite characters I think because the book is getting darker we need someone like these in the series to lighten it up a bit We saw them up to their usual tricks however we also see that they re actually quite smart with all of the crazy inventions they make How could I possibly forget Umbridge You know when you love to loathe a character Well this is a perfect example She s not a nice person she s cruel and highly irritating BUT as a character it was so gripping to see what she d do next What I liked - The family tree in the Black house it was really interesting to see how certain characters linked up with one another- Little reference to SPEW- Prefects - There was so much back story we got the original Order we learnt more about Neville and his family got answers from Dumbledore on Prophecies- Anything Fred and George related along with Hermione trying to tell them off not only that but their farewell to Hogwarts with the Broomsticks I legit laughed for the longest time and the fight on the Quidditch pitch - Hermione saying Voldermorts name I was like YOU GO GIRL - In fact just how intelligent she is in regards to DA she made the coins the Jinx god I loved it setting revision sessions up - Hagrid s Journey - Seeing old characters again Sirius Lupin Moody Lockhart Centaurs then we get the new ones - Tonks Luna Bellatrix Umbridge Giants Kreacher-The unity of the school coming together against Umbridge it was great What I didn t like - I know it s part of the story but I really detested Percy in this book like BOY don t turn your back on your family and the way he treated them it broke my little heart I m supposed to love all of the Weasleys - I find it really difficult to like Snape we see his backstory and it hurt like hell I must admit but he bullies Harry for something his father did yet Dumbledore doesn t really say anything in regards to it - It was sooooooooooo longOverall I m looking forward to Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince I m really excited to carry on and see what happens hopefully I ll be able to actually buddy read this with Fathima instead of powering on ahead the excitement was real Philosopher s Stone - 4 5 StarsChamber of Secrets - 4 StarsPrisoner of Azkaban - 5 StarsGoblet of Fire - 4 5 StarsOrder of the Phoenix - 4 5 Stars more"

"53","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Dec 16 2012"," Erin Proud Book Hoarder","it was amazing"," Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike 4 5This book may not be perfect but it was inching its way toward that finish line I enjoy comedic childlike humor as much as the rest of the fans but to me when the story gets a little darker deeper it gets even better We get a return of favorite characters but as with the other books we also get new ones While the rest of the series introduced new characters that were fun and that we actually wanted to read about here it just seems like two main hate-filled creatures show up Dolores Umbridge shudder and Bellatrix who I can t stand Harry is now 15 and showing it through teenage angst and mood swings Happily this didn t bother me because - let s face it - these are dark times in the young wizard s life and him being happy-go-lucky would just be unrealistic Plus the teenager hormones were already tweaked anyway because of his friends Dumbledore and the wizarding community basically ignoring him for a summer Then you have the Voldemort strange triangle in his head probably fueling that anger I noticed when watching the movie that they played up the potential possession while in the book it was hinted as a possibility left for the reader to muse about themselves and see what happens Hermione and Ron show considerable patience with their temper-triggered friend becoming of all things perfects in the school It was an ironic touch for the series but would have worked just as well without it Loony Luna is a delight because the girl is simply so strange although the convenience of her character s connected to a newspaper owning father comes into play as well There s Fred and George who I always loved in the books but who seem lusterless in the movies - here they rocked with their unique style of misbehavior especially when showing up a certain new villain Where this book shines character-wise is Neville who is so awesome as a friend suddenly and co-fighter There s a teary situation in the hospital and how he stands by Harry stuffed nose and all in a fight later was heart-winning Dumbledore finally gets to show us why he has such an awesome badass reputation in the wizarding world and I couldn t be happier with the two scenes that showed him flexing the magic muscle You know Minister I disagree with Dumbledore on many counts but you cannot deny he s got style Since Snape is a favorite of mine but only shows his face occasionally it was a further delight that Harry had to learn Occlumency from the professor The scenes were intense and although a small subplot mesmerized me They showed a glimpse into the life of Harry s parents before he put them on a pedestal Can we all agree that McGonagall is even more likable after this book I didn t care about her the first few but she keeps growing on me Here she s amazing Sirius ah Sirius This book shows even further that he is dependent upon Harry because he misses James so much and sees the father in the son There was a sad scene in the fire where he withdraws from Harry a bit because he s disappointed He spends much of the book frustrated and lonely which was realistic and deep but depressing I love their relationship both without families but connecting to each other due to that Let s wave aside the villain of Voldemort for this book shall we He s there he s bad but he s not that frequent and he isn t the one who really irritated readers in this one Those badges go to the annoying Umbridge we all loved to hate and the evil Bellatrix Umbridge is around for the majority of book raising shivers of annoyance Besides her arrogant attitude that made me want to slap her there s the beyond disturbing punishment with that blood quill and poor Harry It certainly brought a twisted touch to the series that was almost missing before I hate to see Harry tricked at the end but you can t keep a series real and have the character be perfect in predictions every time The book misses that perfect finish line because there are too many lucky coincidences that come in handy and save the characters throughout fight scenes but they were still imaginative and adventurous It s a large book 870 pages and if you stand back and examine it not a lot of action actually happens Still it s so easy to get sucked in and so hard to look away There s a heartbreaking soul-slapping death that I don t think I ll get over I knew it was coming but couldn t remember the order from the movies when it would show up Sadness It was sudden and shocking and just awful Harry s emotion afterwards was realistic and well done J K Rowling continues this series with talent and the books really do keep getting better and better A timeless series that should continue to bewitch future generations more"

"71","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Nov 13 2007"," Wile","liked it"," I ve been told this was the most difficult to read of the series and I found it to be true Harry is full of teen angst and spends a lot of the book furious and being quite infuriating at the fact that nothing is happening and that when things do happen he s not allowed to be involved Of course not being allowed do things should never stop a boy like Harry Potter from getting involved - except that amazingly it does This book isn t really so much about Harry Potter but about all the other characters and the events that are sweeping the wizarding world Harry eventually gets caught up with fighting the new headmistress brought in due the great changes taking place outside Hogwarts but he s more a witness caught up in events than an actor trying to sort them out While the book lays a great deal of background information and sets up for the last two books there isn t a strong central adventure story that makes this book stand alone What results feels less like a story in the middle of a larger tale and more like a closet where all of the information and loose ends that must be sorted to finish the series have been crammed in like so many bogarts There is a ream s worth of scenes an editor could have blue penciled out to emphasize the story arc with all essential events quite intact Still the narration and dialog is often enjoyable and the actions that Harry does finally end up involving himself in become key in the end Let s hope Harry is past his angst and ready for final battle more"

"79","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Mar 08 2015"," Evelyn devours and digests words","it was amazing"," I wasn t so enthusiastic about revisiting The Order of The Phoenix The water s run deep in this one and I admit while dodging flying rotten tomatoes that this is my least favourite Harry Potter book because SO MANY AWFUL STUFFS happened and will continue to happen in the later books This is the mark of a turning point for Harry and his friends His innocent fascination of the wizarding world is clearly over and the situations he ll have to face now will be darker and full of losses With each reread I ve come to dread many scenes especially that one death that will always strike me as unfair and unjustified YES IT STILL HURTS EVEN AFTER MANY REREADS For one stupid stupid moment I even dare to wish that the scene might somehow alter itself magically this time so that that one death might never happened at all Dolores Umbridge s presence throughout the book soured the situations Everytime she turned up I ll find myself wishing for her death or her expulsion Such a vile old bat I swear Hell I don t know whether to hate her or to admire her sometimes On the plus side I notice that some of the side characters have stood up to a bit of their full heights here Ginny Weasley s become her own person and a bit of Neville Longbottom s courage shone through Also LUNA LOVEGOOD Seriously I have got to give props to Rowling and her uncanny ability to weave up characters you d root for or hate on Enough rambles I m off to nurse my hurt feelings and start the 6th book more"

"82","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," May 18 2016"," Irene","it was amazing"," I cared about you too much I cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth more for your peace of mind than my plan more for your life than the lives that might be lost if the plan failed In other words I acted exactly as Voldemort expects we fools who love to act I ran out of GR characters wowThis book is probably my least favorite of the series IF I m forced under torture to choose one It s pretty slow-paced nearly until the ending I m not saying that throughout it less events or important things happen it s just for me slightly slower compared to the other ones Trouble for Harry is not over Once at home he will receive soon a letter from the Ministry saying that he is expelled from Hogwarts for performing a Patronus Charm in the presence of a Muggle and that a disciplinary hearing was set up at the Ministry Stuck in his bedroom now Harry is left home alone but soon he will meet a very cool pack of people the one and only Order of the Phoenix Lupin Alastor Moody Nymphadora hi there Kingsley Shacklebolt Elphias Dodge Dedalus Diggle Emmeline Vance and Hestia Jones They are there to take him aways to their headquarters Number Twelve Grimmauld Place That s Sirius Black s place and in there Harry is reunited with Hermione and the Weasleys Hermione will explain to Harry what she knows about the Order because she knows always everything And we learn here than the twins are taking very seriously their new business and have actually pretty useful items as well Extendable Ears anyone There s Weasley gossip too Bill and Fleur are working together at Gringotts now and Percy is still too focused on his job but his obsession has been taken to the next level now making him even avoid his own family like what is wrong with you It s time a new house elf Kreacher but he doesn t seem like to be as friendly as Dobby Meeting time for the Order now they talk a little bit of everything and we discover some new things too But What s that thing the tapestry Kreacher had been trying to protect That s actually one of my favorite things from the books The Black Family Tree We get a little glimpse at Sirius past too and that s very interesting 62442 does that sound familiar It s time for the hearing at the Ministry Special mention here that ALL the floors were actually described with their roles We take a little trip of Arthur s office as well we meet his colleague Perkins and we finally encounter The Quibbler I know I know we nearly passed 100 pages and we are already introduced to that Dolores Jean Umbridge But thankfully after what seemed an eternity Harry actually made it he was cleared of all charges Back at home now and surprise The envelopes with the new book list are here PLUS prefect badges Not for Harry though Ron and Hermione were the chosen ones After the celebration dinner Harry was heading upstairs when he suddenly started to hear some noises That was actually a very strong scene to watch and read Molly is struggling with the boggart haunting Number Twelve Grimmauld Place and we have the chance to see her boggart and it s terrifying School term is gonna start soon and it s time once again to go back to Hogwarts We finally meet Luna Lovegood during the journey to get to the castle About time She actually doesn t seem to have a nice reputation among students they call her Loony we later discover that people hide her stuff people are so skeptical on The Quibbler And we learn that Malfoy has been made prefect too Pay attention here the carriages TO HARRY seem NOT to be horseless now We will go back to those winged horses later during Hagrid s class but so far we know that Harry AND Luna are the only ones among the group of friends that can see these creatures Feast time but it s not too cheerful this time once the new professor are introduced we learn that Hagrid is momentary absent and Umbridge is the new DATDA teacher Nice speech you had there Dolores It means the Ministry is interfering at Hogwarts that s what Hermione said Fairly slow-paced chapter now back to study and lessons and it was super fun to read about Hogwarts classes again Friendly reminder that is OWLs year so extra homework for those teens First class with Umbridge and Harry has already lost his temper and he is already in detention lol But he has actually his rights to be angry at Umbridge it s pretty easy to think and say very nice things to her have a biscuit Potter said a wise lady In the next chapter there s A LOT going on Fred and George are all focused on testing their new things Hermione is knitting house-elves hats to free them in honor of SPEW Ron is miraculously the new Gryffindor keeper and Harry is stuck with Dolores in detention And what a detention guys oh boy Punishments certainly cannot be adjusted to suit the guilty one s convenience If this is not enough let s wait to read that super nice and sweet letter that Percy sent to Ron seriously what s your problem bro At least Harry will later have the opportunity to speak to Sirius via fire and have some sense chit chat Meanwhile Umbridge becomes Hogwarts High Inquisitor and in was actually pretty fun even if terribly mean to read all the possible flaws she can find in a teacher Special mention here to the grades O utstanding E exceeded Expectations A cceptable P oor D readful or T roll In all this mess Hermione actually got an illumination why don t we learn to defend ourselves by our own with a competent teacher That s actually well asked Let s do a meeting about to discuss about this and to recruit some people at the Hog s Head Hermione actually did a very good job she spread the voice pretty well and even she was very surprised when that many people showed up After everything was settled down everyone decided to sign for this secret association But Hermione is no fool so once you signed you had to keep it a secret otherwise surprise But we will come back later to that It s time to find a place where to hide all of this tho and here Dobby the house elf has the perfect and coolest place for them the Room of Requirement the Come and Go room That s my FAVORITE place of all the books And finally they decided with which name they want to call this society nice try Cho but Ginny s idea is way better Dumbledore s Army How fun were those pages where we read all those spells and practices Hermione will then reveal the idea she had to make sure everyone will know when a new meeting is about to be set and that s pure genius there It s time for Ron s first Quidditch match now and things can t actually get any worse for him no wait actually In addition to the usual green and silver scarves and hats every one of them was wearing a silver badge in the shape of what seemed to be a crown - with love from the Slytherins Thankfully Luna is there to save the day with her epic hat shaped like a lion The match was actually pretty hurtful to read but that lyrics are no matter what stuck in my head Of course after the match Malfoy is there to tease Ron but Harry and George completely lost their heads and the only thing that achieved was a life ban from Quidditch from the one and only Dolores Umbridge well done guys At least a happy news now more or less Hagrid is back even if not in a very good shape and told the trio everything that happened to him during his absence He is finally back at the Care of Magical Creatures post BUT Umbridge is just around the corner ready to inspect him and his way of teaching and we know how Hagrid is First lesson back in action Thestrals And finally is explained why actually no one can see these winged horses except for Harry Luna and Neville Hermione Explain please The only people who can see Thestrals are people who have seen death It s Christmas Tiiime Have a very Harry Christmas The banned one got finally replaced and it s time to one last DA meeting before the holidays And in here happens The kiss we were all being waiting for kinda not me at least lol After months of blushing here and there and thinking oh her and blah blah Harry finally kissed Cho Then situation was pretty awkward if you ask me she was actually crying her eyes out for Cedric and suddenly their mouths just met okay Oh wait there was mistletoe so Epic line here Hermione has as always the perfect words when boys just can t get it Just because you ve got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn t mean we all have Oooooh snap Ron lolAnd from here things get worse and worse Starting with the super creepy but unfortunately real dream vision Harry had during a tumultuous night Arthur Weasley just got injured by a snake And soon after they are actually heading to St Mungos Hospital to visit Mr Weasley Another special mention here to the descriptions around St Mungo s from how to get there who works there the floors guide The kids though are now starting to question why Arthur got attacked by this snake and is George asking if he was actually attacked because he was guarding the thing that LV is after And adults are starting too to ask questions on how it was possible that Harry could see all of this and they are worried that LV is actually possessing the boy Even if Harry is not feeling cheerful at all because he s thinking that it was actually HIM who attacked Arthur it s time to celebrate Christmas at Grimmauld Place and to visit again Mr Weasley at St Mungo s This time though the trio will encounter two other people they know in there the one and only Gilderoy Lockhart and their fellow friend Neville Harry already knows his past and thinking about it it s very heartbreaking Back at Grimmauld Place Harry will have a little talk with Severus Snape he is there on Dumbledore s orders he has the task to teach Occlumency to Harry he has to shut his mind basically We learn here that Harry is very bad at doing this and for Snape is very easy to take a ride in Harry s memories but is Harry himself that tells him about the Department of Mysteries visions Shortly after there s a mass breakout from Azkaban and in all this mess Harry actually managed to ask Cho out for Valentine s Day lolThe famous date is set during their Hogsmeade trip but this went terribly wrong Cho in here is acts like an infant and I m so glad that all this romance between the two is officially over thank you Hermione lolShe has in fact way more important stuff to think of and her geniousness brought her to collab even with Rita Skeeter hey what s better than a journalist for the most famous newspaper to try to convince people that Harry is telling the truth about LV comeback uh But there s Luna too there and her father has a magazine too and between the two it is Luna that wins Harry s interview And soon after it s released for real Meanwhile Harry keeps having those visions and has once again Occlumency lessons with Snape In here Harry successfully protects himself but he gets a first glimpse at Snape s memories Umbridge takes a step too forward now She decides based on what she saw that Professor Tralawney must leave the school for good In here we see a pretty pissed Dumbledore that immediately takes the situation under control more or less and convinces Sybill to stay because Umbridge has actually no power to decide who has to actually leave the castle She is going to be replaced though by Firenze decided by Dumbledore Finally during DA lessons they started working on Patronuses but this is actually going to be their last DA meeting Umbridge and the the people going under the name Inquisitorial Squad found them with a little help right Marietta Cool thing is that Dumbledore tells that it s Dumbledore s Army so he organized all of this and tonight was supposed to be their first meeting yeah From here he fights with Fudge about the same matters and what an exit guys You know Minister I disagree with Dumbledore on many counts but you cannot den he s got style Good thing is that now Umbridge is Headmistress yuhu well no that s the worst thing that could have happened after Dumbledore leaving the school In here get a first glimpse of what the Weasley s twins will be up soon those fireworks guys But Harry has to focus on Snape s lesson so back to Occlumency No wait Umbridge requires Snape s help shortly after lol And it s not Harry Potter anymore if he is left alone in Snape s office and after seeing a silver light on a Pensive he just stays away Nope that s Harry of course he will dive almost immediately into the memory without almost even thinking about the consequences This is a VERY important moment We finally learn a lot more of Snape s past and how he was doing during school time not so great friends by the way poor thing And boom present Snape is back in his office and throws at Harry a jar of dead cockroaches Well that s not actually so bad it could have been worse come on Before starting the OWLs exams students are having some chit chat with their teachers to learn which path they will take after school which job This chapter is actually pretty interesting and we learn a little bit more of the various possibilities that you can choose Harry s first thought though is about his father After what he saw in the Pensieve he is not that sure if he see his father like a hero as he used to do But for that there s Sirius with all his advices and explanations Meanwhile the twins give Ron a special appointment Gregory the Smarmy s corridor around about five o clock tomorrow You think it s amusing to turn a school corridor into a swamp do you HELL YEAH I d say lol That exit was EPIC and now let s all together go to number ninety-three Diagon Alley shall we Weasleys Wizard Wheezes it s finally a thing Back to school activities now it s time for another Quidditch Match but when actually Ron succeeds the other two are in the Forest with Hagrid because he decided that it was time for them to meet his brother Grawp NOW Ok another super cool and slow-paced chapter It s examination time That chapter is one of my favourites ever We truly follow the exams journey all the subjects and arguments too The Astronomy one turn out a little too much animated there was a series of not too joyful events going on outside And of course during his last examination Harry has another vision Harry is super worried now because he saw Sirius being attacked and he feels so powerless right now he has no idea what to do and his friends are a little reluctant too about all this But he is the boss there so he begs them to distract Umbridge while he uses her fireplace which is the only one not watched to see if he is at Grimmauld Place safe or if the vision might be actual true Of course he is busted and with him all his friends an together they have to deal with Umbridge and the Slytherins Snape is there too and Harry sends him a cryptic but not so cryptic for him message He s got Padfoot at the place where it s hidden Meanwhile genius Hermione finds a way to have Umbridge s attention revealing that they were trying to speak to Dumbledore because the secret weapon in finally ready Where is it found In the Forbidden Forest and so all together they went But that s home of the centaurs too and we know that they are not that friendly especially after they were insulted by Dolores She is in fact finally taken away by them only problem is that the centaurs are angry with the other two too thank goodness Grawp is there ready to save his Hermy Now Harry Hermione and Ron are reunited with some allies too Ginny Neville and Luna are there to help and together they fly on thestrals to the Department of Mysteries It took them a while in there to finally find something curious and extremely valuable It s - it s got your name on yes Ron found THE prophecy This is the beginning of an epic battle between Death Eaters and students later helped by the Order of the Phoenix But we have to focus mainly of the duel Sirius vs Bellatrix One of the most iconic scenes in here at least for me Everything happens in a blink of a eye you seriously don t even realize what s going to happened The second jet of flight hit him squarely on the chest It seemed to take Sirius an age to fall his body curved in a graceful arc as he sank backwards through the ragged veil hanging from the arch I will never forget how in next chapter I could feel all Harry s feeling it was like a bomb thrown at this boy and his instinct tells him to immediately go after the killer Bellatrix and experiment with her favorite spell crucio LV has appeared meanwhile Dumbledore finally arrives too to save the situation at least what it s possible Another epic battle here between LV and the Headmaster And of course in the end everyone at the Ministry decided to show up Fudge included and finally believes in what s has been told to him for a year now Back in the castle now Harry is in Dumbledore s office and he is soo pissed and angry He has a mess of emotions but can you blame him The prophecy got smashed LV is after him like a crazy psycho Bella just killed his only remaining family member Just give him a break Fortunately Dumbledore has always the right words and even in this case taking things way slower he is able to talk to Harry about a ton of important and fatal things here Harry I own you an explanation an explanation of an old man s mistake This chapter is probably the most important out of the all book In here the Headmaster tell Harry the prophecy made by the one and only Sybill and we finally know why LV is after this kid and especially that neither can live while the other survives Hey that s A LOT to handle for a 15 year old teen after everything he has already been through especially during that same day After the official announcement of the Dark Lord s comeback time will even darker and darker and people are most frightened than ever Another school year has ended everyone is heading home not in a cheerful way because they know that next year will be even worse and we know that too Last but least Ron spoils us with a little touch of Ginny Harry ship As final thoughts I think the beginning is pretty slow-paced compared to the others There are still so many events but it could have been cut a little my personal opinion This doesn t discredit the book that is probably the most important of the series We finally have the big reveal and separates the series between before LV official return and after We see even more characters development in here the emotions felt by this kids are very on focus as well as the plot development Every time something new is added new hints are left here and there but at the same time the main storyline keeps growing bigger and bigger every time more"
"83","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Dec 20 2013"," Shelby trains flying monkeys","it was amazing"," I started these books thinking I some what liked Harry Potter s story I mean I had watched the movies How much love could you expect a 44 year old woman to give to a children s book I never imagined how these books would cast a spell on my heart and mind I have slowed down in my reading of them just because I know the end of them is near and I know I m going to shed some tears You think if you ve watched the movies you know these stories not These books are just completely and utterly magic You can t represent them in film It just can t be done The movies were cute when I watched them sure but nothing like the books This one started very slow and I thought Harry was a big whine ass I kept reading This book is written for children How did I get so attached to it These characters come to life-you see them as human Neither bad nor good Isn t that what we all are Enjoy these pics while I go cry awhile more"
"84","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Jun 16 2011"," Vanessa","really liked it"," I am so thankful that I revisited this book again after so long away When I originally read this instalment of the Harry Potter series I gave it 3 stars and now on a re-read I m seeing it in a new light and it s up to a 4 Who knows will it be a 5 on another re-read We ll see The things that annoyed me so much the first time around namely Harry s teenage angst actually seemed a lot more understandable and relatable at the age I am now as opposed to the very early teens that I was upon publication In fact it was interesting to read this book at the age of 27 and feel more critical of some of the adult characters that I know and love so much namely Sirius and Molly They made decisions and said things that I 100 did not agree with and actually made me quite critical of their characters but it just allowed me to appreciate the writing and construction of the characters more Dolores Umbridge is still in my eyes 100 the most evil thing about this book series - screw Voldemort this woman is the devil I absolutely loved and hated reading her character again because I could live vicariously through the DA Overall this was so much fun and I m so glad I finally got around to re-reading this one as I ve put it off for more than 10 years It was long overdue but so beneficial in the long run more"

"86","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Sep 25 2009"," Mike the Paladin","it was amazing"," Wonderful book only complaint I ever heard was it was too short Still the emotional toll of this book is heavier than the ones before and it is more a young adult book than a youth book As I ve pointed out before the original generation reading these books had more time to mature between the publishing date of each book Now they can be bought all together Harry goes through some amazingly tough times and doesn t handle some of them too well Read these books before you simply turn them over to your kids You ll enjoy them and be able to decide if your children are ready for this volume This book is a somewhat emotionally draining book due to what Harry is going through The body of the book right up to the heavy climax will draw you in and hold you Again we are moving into a darker side of Harry s world Review to be expanded more"

"90","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Jan 20 2017"," Iryna Book and Sword","it was amazing"," This one took me a while not because of the size of it but because of how hard it is to go through all of the emotions portrayed in this book This is my 2nd time reading the series I read it for the first time almost exactly a year ago and I was surprised at how fresh it felt I wasn t feeling like hey I read this before I know what s going to happen but instead I relived all of the emotions as they were new - I am not even going to explain how much I hate Umbridge I know we all do I will say that it is terrifying though how much a person with government power can do and how helpless everybody else can be Talking about government and politics I have to say that I love how books grew with the audience 1st book was quite light and easy to access for the middle grade reader and now book 5 carries messages that are better understood by an older audience - The true evil in this book for me at least was not Voldemort but the Ministry Because wizards are a figment of imagination but people like Fudge and Umbridge are very much real - Harry was very hard to read in this book Because he portrayed every single emotion all of us felt at least once in our life Jealousy of your friends that one was so relatable it hurt betrayal pain rage loss confusion guilt and many many more - Bullying is always present in J K Rowling s books but in this book it was especially painful I was ENRAGED to see Hermione and the whole lot of them call Luna loony behind her back - When Harry reads the message on the back of the mirror that Sirius gave him That scene broke the last piece of my heart that was still intact If only Harry wasn t so proud and stubborn and opened his present from Sirius he could have contacted him so much easier It s amazing how such a little detail could be so monumental in a book - At this point the story is so vast and complicated I don t know how Rowling kept it all organized Her drafts must have been crazy Or maybe neatly organized and labeled as Hermione s would My WEBSITEMy INSTAGRAMMy WORDPRESS BLOG more"

Flamed Torch Not one of my prouder moments As soon as the book became available for Well I know that for the last three books the story of how I read them has been less than epic but fear not the story picks up a bit from here Summer 2003 came along I had just graduated from college and I was anxiously awaiting the release of the fifth Harry Potter book I was so anxious in fact that I actually fell for and spread around the story that volume 5 would be called Harry Potter and The Green Flamed Torch Not one of my prouder moments As soon as the book became available for preorder I went to my college computer lab which I mysteriously still had access to and ordered my copy online Unfortunately I failed to order it from an online store that would deliver it on the day it came out It would be shipped on the day it came out As it turned out my brother got married the weekend of the book s release The wedding was on Friday and the book came out on Saturday Saturday morning my sister brother-in-law my niece and I all got in their car and started heading home We pulled off the highway into the first major town we could find and started driving around looking for a Walmart so they could get their copies of the book Finally we spotted one and my sister and I started cheering like crazy people My 1- year old niece stared at us with a very confused look on her face as she wondered what in the world Crazy Uncle Ryan and mommy were doing My sister and her husband both bought copies of the book and we started back out on the road As we drove we took turns reading out loud and as Harry was sitting with Luna and Neville on the Hogwarts Express we pulled into my apartment complex They left me there and I was stuck without a book I watched countless friends reading the book over the next few days I expressly forbad them from telling me anything about what happened as I checked the mail every single day wondering when my copy would actually arrive During that wait a nice girl I knew let me borrow her copy one evening as she told me she was not going to read any more that night I ran back to my apartment with the book under my arm cackling fiendishly and I read as much as I could knowing that I would have to return the book the next day All in all I ended up using three or four different copies before I finished reading this book I then didn t see it for at least a month as I loaned it out to several friends to read There were several times during this book that I get really frustrated with Harry These times involve him loosing his temper with Umbridge So many times I just found myself shouting at the book telling Harry to control his temper and not yell at her again That woman is the DEVIL I can t think of any character in the whole series that I dislike more than her and I include Voldemort in that It s no wonder that Rowling named her Dolores Umbridge The name Dolores comes from the Latin word for pain Umbrage yes Rowling changed the spelling for the name means anger or resentment caused by some real or imagined wrong That certainly describes her attitude and outlook accurately Umbrage can also mean a shadow She certainly is a dark presence that seems to brood over people This book also contains what I think are the two most powerful and moving scenes in the series Neither of which incidentally made it into the movie version The first of these is the scene in St Mungo s where we see Neville visiting his parents That scene along with the battle in the Department of Mysteries should leave no doubt in any reader s mind that in spite of the fact that he is rather clumsy and awkward Neville is extremely brave and absolutely belongs in Gryffindor The second is the scene at the end after Sirius death when Harry rages at Dumbledore and their subsequent conversation You finally see all the anger and sadness that had been building up inside Harry since the end of book 4 come out and we all FINALLY get the answer we had been waiting for so long as to why Voldemort came after Harry in the first place That s a very good scene Of course one of the coolest parts in this book if not in the whole series is the wizard s duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort I love how Dumbledore is dueling the most feared dark wizard ever and keeps calling him Tom and speaking to him as though he we still his teacher and Voldemort is nothing more than a misbehaving student That and the scene where Dumbledore tells Fudge that he has no intentions of going to Azkaban and than proceeds to knock out everyone is his office and disappears with Fawkes in a flash of fire just make you realize that Dumbledore is the most awesome wizard ever more"

"131","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Mar 20 2010"," Trish","it was amazing"," The 5th book about Harry Potter is no doubt the longest and at least to me the hardest one to read Every scene is tinged every happy moment soon ruined by new ugliness or at least it feels that way More than physical violence the psychological effects of this novel are what make it so bad We have severe bullying not just by students but also by teachers most notably by Umbridge plots torturous longing basically the situation is hopeless and Hogwarts feels less and less like a safe home I must say at first I was looking forward to getting far more details in the book version which I got but have to admit upon finishing it that the movie has a few moments that are superior to the book version The DA meetings for example the way Neville evolves the different tasks or Luna s role being silently brilliant with interventions like during the recruitment meeting in the Hogshead when she moved the conversation to Patronuses that sealed the deal in Harry s favour or the line It s like Hogwarts wants us to fight back that never happened and wasn t exactly hinted at either since it was Dobby who mentioned the Room Of Requirement or the far more extensive and impressive fight between Dumbledore and Voldemort or the equally more awesome way the twins take their leave Of course there are some moments that are far better in the book too like the more detailed account of the lessons Care Of Magical Creatures especially and Divination once Firenze takes over but also the importance of the OWLs and career advice all the little hints that help Harry and the others solving the mystery of the weapon not to mention the prophecy itself and Neville fitting the first part as much as Harry Dobby having a role at all and a good one Hermione s attempt at freeing the house elves several character developments for which there was just no time in the movie Ginny the whole Percy problem and Neville s and his parents backstory the financing of the twins joke products the flashbacks during Harry s Occlumency lesson the different rooms in the Ministry s Department Of Mysteries There are quite some stabs from Rowling towards people who follow rules for the sake of following rules never looking past the tips of their own noses and how supposed good guys can be truly sinister She also likes to highlight at several points how hypocritical witches wizards are first with the statue at the Ministry giving it a more real albeit bleak feel and that thoughts can leave deep scars one of the sneakiest and most brilliant lines in my opinion By the way for anyone having deeper thoughts about Ginny like Brad and a few others here let me say this Harry might have had a nasty moment in this book when he tried to tell Ginny and Neville and Luna to stay behind and not get mixed up in his business and failed wonderfully but we know by then that she is not just gifted but very strong too anyway Nevertheless the trio never became a quartet Many take offense at that especially considering that she later becomes Harry s wife But here s the thing Ginny is like her mother Molly powerful but actively deciding not to need or want to be part of the big adventure except for this one time in this book but to take care of friends and family members instead She decides not to go with Harry when Ron and Hermione basically force Harry to take them along And there is nothing wrong with that As is shown through Molly in the 7th book true gender equality doesn t mean an intelligent strong woman HAS to be a bad-ass actively waging war like Wonder Woman all the time It means having the choice whatever that choice is and every choice being correct because it is what the respective person wants Besides being a housewife mother doesn t mean she can t be a powerful witch it s not always either one or the other McGonagall was in the Ministry but became a teacher one might call this a step down since she is powerful but in truth she simply stays where she is needed the most Hogwarts and can achieve the most although she s in the Order Just saying Then we have Umbridge of course It is noteworthy how wonderfully Rowling draws her characters Where we have the almost boringly perfect evil that is Lord Voldemort Rowling gives us far more nuanced people with the Malfoys other Death Eaters like Fenrir Greyback who might not have become just this wild and awful had he not been mistreated for being a werewolf and Dolores Umbridge This pink fluffy toad-like woman seriously is the worst if you ask me One of those people giving a nice impression wanting everything neat and in order no room for creativity or individuality Let me tell you from personal experience that it is seemingly nice people like that keeping a perfect appearance on the outside that are the true evil in this world Here of course that is emphasized whenever she is mistreating people especially halfbreeds or even torturing students although physical torture isn t the worst it s just the crass thing we get to see to drive home the point Anyway the novel is action-packed but also thoughtful fast-paced and reflective funny Lord Thingy yet tragic the narrative intelligent from start to finish P S I won t forgive those stunning spells against my beloved McGonagall though more"
"132","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Apr 06 2013"," Angela","it was amazing"," The longest book - by more than a hundred pages - in the series many have complained that this is one of their least favorites And I admit it was my 2nd least favorite for a very long time When I finally re-read it a few years ago I revised my opinion It s now one of my top favorites When I first read it as a young-adult I was really annoyed with Harry s actions and attitude I got frustrated with his frustrations and anger It s funny that it took me getting older to actually become more understanding of this I m not sure if I was too close to that defiance and attitude from my own teenage years and too disgusted with how I treated people during it or what but I ve come to be incredibly sympathetic and understanding Harry is actually quite reserved and thoughtful in this book considering the circumstances And he actually has excellent reasons for feeling the way he does That s not to say that I m not frustrated ever during this book I definitely still get frustrated It s just for different reasons now Mostly the same reasons as Harry A lot is being held back from Harry in this book and I really think he deserves to know more More knowledge - as Dumbledore especially should know - is never a bad thing And perhaps if he d known a bit more there wouldn t have been quite the devastation to follow I know everyone loves Molly Weasley I m not one of them at least not in this book I love that she loves Harry and she considers him as good as one of her sons but she like Ron got on my nerves in this book It s not her place to decide what s right for Harry She did something similar in Prisoner of Azkaban and her brand of protection actually leaves Harry open to more danger I wish she d realize that and stop trying to help And I know you re supposed to but I HATE Umbridge I can t even express the amount of hate that I have for this woman She s a very good cautionary tale about what happens when zealotry has power Something that s even more scary to me right now what with the insanity going on within the democratic system in the US at the moment So many things to love though 1 Tonks - I d almost like to be a metamorphagus2 12 Grimmauld Place - I love the play on words that JKR uses3 Ginny in general - considering how much I disliked her in Chamber of Secrets this is a huge thing4 Extendable Ears - I love Fred and George5 Doxies6 Department of Mysteries7 Dumbledore s testimony8 Luna Lovegood9 Quibbler10 Sorting Hat s Song - and this leads into one of my biggest regrets with the series as a whole - I ll touch on it in my Deathly Hallows review11 O W Ls - Ordinary Wizarding Levels12 I must not tell lies - GRRRRRRRR13 Angelina Quidditch Captain14 Boys trying to get in Girls dormitory - LOL I love the slide15 Snape vs Umbridge16 Dumbledore s Army17 Weasley is our king 18 Ginny - again19 St Mungo s20 Droobles Best Blowing Gum wrapper21 McGonagall vs Umbridge22 Give her hell from us Peeves 23 Fred George vs Umbridge24 All teachers vs Umbridge25 Neville Ginny yes again Luna Hermione and RonI also really love Dumbledore I know that in this book in particular he s not everyone s favorite - and I question him myself sometimes - but by the end I adore him more than ever I can t say that I love the end but it s amazingly well done - it brings out a boatload of emotions in me and I think that s probably why it was one of my least favorites - the emotions hit a bit too close to home when I read it originally and then I have always associated this book with that time in my life It s natural but now that the pain s lessened a bit I can look back on it and feel the missing naturally And well I do love it for that I guess It s so real and true The emotions are honest and real This book has gradually become one of my favorites in the entire series - and it s so much better than the movie Honestly if you think they can fit 870 pages into a single movie then I don t even know what to say There s so much that s truncated or missing entirely Things that are moved to the next movie or never even mentioned And as I read this time I was struck again but how vivid and deep this world is and how much I love being in it This review also available at The Book Eaters more"
"133","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Feb 12 2015"," Jonathan Terrington","really liked it"," This is probably the best entry in the Harry Potter series to this point In my personal opinion the novels begin as average stories at best - with Rowling trying to gain a proper control over her writing voice and style They do show delightful promise with the worldbuilding and some sense of nice-enough characters but all in all it s clear that marketing played a huge hand in selling the books early on I m not cynical enough to say marketing was all that did it Rowling has a distinctly British charm and humour that shines even through her early books and the world of Hogwarts provides a fantastic fantasy setting However something is missing from the first three books that is more present in this novel Perhaps it is the nuanced political commentary - through displaying the failing inner workings of the Ministry of Magic Rowling appears to provide a critique on normal human political systems The ideas that she displays include that in trying to do good often laws are designed for those in power to keep power and secondly that those in power often fight among each other for power when they should be fighting bigger problems facing the world This rings true for politics in Australia at the moment in particular where it seems as if the government and opposition government are busier fighting internal party battles than actually passing legislation Perhaps it is the increased and improved characterisation present in this novel that causes this to be a more improved novel You have Harry Hermione and Ron showing more depth to different aspects of their personalities with their various fears and desires as teenagers and heroes being exposed The fact that Harry houses more raw anger in this novel to go alongside his perfect heroic goodness leads him to become a more three dimensional figure The same applies to his friends however I think the most development of side characters is shown through Dumbledore and Snape Firstly because Dumbledore has more of an active role in this novel s plot and secondly because we see some of Snape s tragic misunderstood childhood All I can admit is that this series is growing on me and I can see the unique brilliance and appeal now in how the audience for Harry Potter grew up alongside the characters It s a nice series if not particularly groundbreaking with some charming moments and a clever magical world I look forward to seeing how the last two books now play out more"

"144","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," May 16 2013"," Mizuki",""," Important Note I I have not read this book and the sequels after it and have no intention to read them but recently I ve been discussing J K Rowling s treatment of her female characters and what kind of message impression her books actually give out to readers concerning the issues of women being in charge Since I can t remember much about those characters names so do forgive me to refer those HP characters as what s-her-name Important Note II I only read the first four books of the series and see no reason to continue reading So people kindly put your You should read the whole series suggestion on hold Here s my finding 1 There re a few of female professors in the magical boarding school I don t bother to check the name up and I especially remember one of them being just a stereotyped crazy auntie type who acts feeble-minded and is pretty much useless Here you go for Rowling s version of woman with a teaching position 2 Plus after Dumbledore is removed from his position we have that female what s-her-name school president who is evil and feeble-minded and cruel to HP to take over Dumbledore s position Oh hell so when a woman gets to be in charge her performance has to be worse than a guy s Here you go for Rowling s version of woman being in charge How insulting 3 Not to mention in book 4 of the series there s this Rita-what s-her-family-name paparazzi character whose purpose of existence is to tell horrible lies about Harry Potter and Co then sells those lies to the public a character whom we re supposed to dislike Here you go for Rowling s version of woman with a job 4 Not to mention the example of good adult woman in the story is Molly a full time housewife 5 Hermoine one of the few saving grace of this series is often being presented as an annoying know-it-all and her effort of freeing the House Elves is being treated by both her friends and her creator Rowling herself as a joke To add insult to injure Hermoine s flaws seems to always be highlighted and made fun of whilst Harry and Ron s flaws are always seem to be forgiven and or put-up-with Here you go for Rowling s version of a smart caring girl Fuck This Shit Don t get me wrong I m 100 okay with women being housewives but when 1 to 5 all adding together I find it rather hilarious to claim Rowling is oh-so pro-feminism Perhaps I m being biased but I honestly can t recall an example of woman being in charge in HP whilst being presented in a good light Conclusion I m not saying J K Rowling is an anti feminist and there is no strong likable female character in the series but I m not happy with how those strong likable female characters are being assigned by their creator to be mere helpers of the menfolk then they didn t do much outside of tagging along and being supportive when the guys went out to have adventures more"

"159","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," May 04 2007"," Joe","really liked it"," After reading this book for a second time I ve decided to dock it a star It s still a good book very well written but I have some grievances to bring to Ms J K s attention SPOILER WARNING At 870 pages it is very laborious to get through this tome when every other sentence brings a new disaster problem for Harry Drama is fine but to this level at this length is just overdoing it Starting with the dementor attack in the first few pages and continuing through Umbridge s evilness all the way to Sirius death which on second read seems tacked on and unnecessary What makes Four and Six so good is that they retain the sense of fantasy wonder that drew so many readers to the series in the first place The Triwizard Tournament 4 and the Horocruxes 6 were just plain cool The tournament was a fun story element and set up what is thus far the most important few chapters in the series The horocruxes presented a great plot for the whole book and gave a basis for where the series is actually going to head down the stretch But what was there in 5 There is a bare minimum of quidditch dumbledore s army is a very minor part the Grawp storyline is total filler the whole thing with the department of mysteries isn t all that engaging until the climax and then ends with a silly prophecy Why doesnt Voldemort just steal harry s wand tie cinder blocks to his legs and throw him in the lake and a much-too-quick duel between Dumbledore and Mr Riddle There s just not enough fun in this book Although i did like how the Cho subplot was dealt with And then at the very end after all the doom and gloom Rowling drops the ball on giving a glimmer of happiness When Harry leaves the train platform some of the Order is there including much of the Weasley family But where is Percy Now that nobody is denying that V-thug is back it would have been the perfect opportunity to show that Percy is back with the good guys without having it be overblown and sappy This book is probably the most confounding of the six so far since when you look back at it after nearly 900 pages and seemingly so much going on there was very little substance as far as the big picture goes Fudge now believes Dumbledore Sirius is dead Is there really anything else that happened in this book that matters Umbridge was just there to be the cunty character that Rita was in 4 and doesnt figure into 6 at all Occlumency seemed interesting but it ended with Harry giving up and us learning that Snape doesn t like Harry or his dad really This rant could all end up negated if certain aspects get flushed out in 7 This happened in 6 when it turned out the diary in 2 wasn t just a cheesy little contrivance We shall find out soon more"
"160","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Mar 01 2016"," Urmi The Ink Witch of Ink World","it was amazing"," My Actual Rating 6 5 Full Stars Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike So I must say that this book is my second favourite one in the series after The Chamber of Secrets And what do you think happens after you read a GOOD book Any guesses Yeah in the words of Rowling something MAGICAL definitely occurs The Order of the Phoenix is when the Harry Potter books begin to get complicated throughout the next few books seemingly tiny incidents will happen which will eventually become fundamentally important to the story as a whole These range from simple character developments to personal flashbacks and important discoveries which will eventually help win the war against Voldermort This is the longest book in the series but it is a cracking read with so much going on and the pace once again picking up from the first page This book really explores Harry s potential and his past which opens up more surprises than you would think The battle scenes are very complex and you may find yourself having to re-read them in order to get your head round what is happening but as always JK Rowling makes your commitment more than worthwhile This might be a harder read for younger children than previous books but it is no less enjoyable and continues to build the suspense of the story There are some wonderful touches Sirius Black s family home where Harry Hermione and Ron hide out when being pursued by the Ministry of Magic being one and we once again see much loved characters such as Remus Lupin This book is very dark in places and we see that our hero isn t infallable giving him yet another dimension and allowing us to identify with his struggles There is humour also so it s certainly not all doom and gloom An excellent book and wonderfully engrossing read till date Henceforth the books begin to get darker and more troubling both for Harry and the reader Yet as ever they are written brilliantly the images Rowling creates and the characters themselves are so strong that they translate beyond the poor editing that afflicts all the books Things are finally beginning to get interesting here and upon closing the Order of the Phoenix you will simply find yourself even more excited and intrigued than you were upon first opening it more"

"192","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Nov 30 2017"," Larissa Book Bosomed Blonde","liked it"," This Review can also be found HEREI have spent days trying to write this review and figure out my thoughts about this book so i decided since i am literally stuck in the middle with how i feel i will be rating this book in the middle as well Now this doesn t mean the book was necessarily bad or good in my opinion because it had both good and bad qualities to it I did like the book but it definitely wasn t up to the standards of the other 4 i have read thus far The writing style seems to have been lacking that engaging element that was there in the other books and it made it hard for me to even pick up the book and continue reading at times It felt like the flow hard gone awry and it made for a disjunction in the story Maybe it was that the book was so long and a lot of it was written with Harry s internal struggling rather than outward contact It just felt like there was a lot that could have been left out or even shortened to make it more enjoyable There is one part that s written in the book of Harry being angry in his own head for nearly 10 pages and this sort of thing happened quite frequently throughout I understand why he is frustrated and that he is having a hard time dealing with everything that has happened in his life thus far but that didn t have to take up the majority of the book There were much more important parts that could have used those additional pages to further develop the plot s intensity I also found my thoughts starting to drift off a lot during the story which never really happened to me in the other 4 books I had to constantly reread pages because i realised that i had not taken in a single word of it The writing was deeply disappointing for what i have come to expect from J K Rowling s books and it threw the rest of the story off The main characters also seemed to have muddled personalities I didn t really know what was going on with them and it seemed like their main attributes disappeared into a shell There was a lot of new characters added to this book though so it could have been a combination of blended personalities which made the unique identifying factors lost through each person Although after Harry witnessing the death of one of his fellow schoolmates and having to battle Voldemort in the graveyard Book 4 it makes sense for there to be a change in him This is clearly prevalent throughout this book and it definitely attributes to the dark and moody atmosphere I think that J K Rowling also could have been mainly focused on the new prominent figurehead in the book because she was definitely written well and you can tell that she gave a lot of attention to this particular individual I have to say i seriously hated this new character but it just goes to show that J K Rowling has got the talent to make a character so loathable that they feel like i real person I did however love the Weasley Twins part in this book Wow were they ever the highlight I really love their personalities and how they lighten up even the darkest of times I can honestly say that one whole star of my rating is attributed to them Unfortunately i didn t enjoy this book to the full extent i wish i could have There were definitely some highlighted moments that made me laugh out loud and cringe in disgust hatred J K Rowling is a really great writer it just didn t come through well enough in this novel for me sadly There is still two more books that can make up for this one though and i haven t given up hope more"
"193","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Jan 27 2018"," MaryJane","it was amazing"," I ve honestly lost track of how many times I have read this series but its FINE Order of the Phoenix is always the book I dread reading the most despite the fact that I actually have no issues with it while I m reading it There is just so much that happens in this one that I DON T LIKE and wish I could avoid and yet it is all so important to the plot so my heart must suffer through it time and time again I frequently refer to this one as my least favorite but that is only because whenever I read anything about Umbridge I want to tear my book in half SO yeah enough about THAT here is a list of things I love in this one - NEVILLE FUCKING LONGBOTTOM Like I always had a soft spot in my heart for him but this book this FUCKING book is the one where my love for him grows to enormous amounts - Ginny finally getting credit she deserves Love seeing her finally become a character that gets a decent amount of attention - The DA and all of their meetings Enough said - GIVE HER HELL FROM US PEEVES ICONIC - Thestrals I love them - Luna Lovegood She is so odd in this one but like I m here for it you feel me - Harry s angst Like yes boo don t ignore your feelings let it all out Plus the fact that not once but TWICE people walk into a room after Harry is shouting about shit and are like Oh I thought I heard Harry shouting like it s the most normal thing in the world - All the preparation for what comes next kinda boring but honestly so important so I can dig it - Even tho I hate Umbridge I gotta appreciate that Rowling could create a character who has such an impact on me - Plus also just all of the feels that are tied into this book UGH Idk I think one of the other reasons I m not as crazy about this one as I am the rest is because half blood prince is my favorite so while I m reading this one I m just wanting to get through it so I can read book 6 instead Oops BUT ANYWAYS ONTO THE NEXT ONE more"

so lost I truly have ZERO idea where I m supposed to start Ok I m just going to start typing whatever comes to mind first HARRY S MOODINESS OH MY GOD it was so FRUSTRATING being inside his head during this book because he was always so ANGRY And I didn t exactly hate that Ok it was INFURIATING when he went off on Ron Hermione but his angst was so raw and real it took the story itself on a whole other level Can you blame him for being upset He s basically shut out from the situation all summer break without anyone telling him whats going on in the Wizarding World it s not exactly fair is it But it was so sad watching him have a difficult time this time around in Hogwarts because of all the nasty things happening once Umbridge showed up and nobody believed him about Voldemort s return UMBRIDGE OH MY GOD The b ch I LITERALLY CRINGED EVERY TIME SHE SHOWED UP SHE WAS SO AWFUL MY GOD HOW TO EXPRESS MY HATRED AAGSHGDH But BUT I watched the movies before reading this series So I knew what happened to this god-awful toad looking creature So I truly enjoyed every single scene she was in just thinking of how it ends for her Dumbledore s detachment this time around Harry can t confide in Dumbledore because he s basically avoiding Harry Watching Harry feel so alone and betrayed by Dumbledore physically hurts BUT THAT ENDING WHERE DUMBLEDORE BEARS HIS HEART AND SOUL TO HARRY WOWOWOWOWOWOW No words can explain That was a FANTASTIC scene Dumbledore s Army THESE SCENES WERE EVERYTHING Every time it was announced that a meeting would take place my heart would soar because they were absolutely my favorite parts of the book They were the rare times where Harry was truly happy in this story which made every single scene spectacular Cho God I can t I CANNOT Out of everybody EVEN UMBRIDGE I really REALLY couldn t stand Cho Ginny Her badassery is FINALLY coming to the surface and I m LOVING EVERY MOMENT She s becoming a very interesting character because she s basically a mixture of her brothers best qualities she s loyal mischievous brave quirky funny an amazing girl Can you see the ship floating Can you see it The fact that Ron is also 100 onboard the Harry Ginny ship is giving me life I CANNOT WAIT for Half-Blood Prince because I think it s when they ll finally have their moment now that Cho is finally out of the picture Hagrid s story I didn t really like it I found it very anti-climactic and frankly pointless Grawp was an excellent addition to the story but Hagrid s secrecy and detachment in a time when Harry really needed him was extremely frustrating Occlumency You know when I said that the DA meetings were my favorite parts Yeah well I lied because OCCLUMENCY MEETINGS WITH SNAPE ARE EVERYTHING You guys may not know but Snape is one of my most beloved characters of all time For SO LONG I love hated him during the movies but once the final movie came out I became loyal to him Snape is one of the most fascinating characters I ve ever read watched and this book cemented my love for him The Occlumency meetings were perfection and now that I ve read the book I can honestly slow-clap to the movie actors because that scene was SPOT-ON When I read the book I was literally picturing every single word in my head just like the movie portrayed it and that was amazing The things we learn from Snape s past during these meetings were so revealing and eye-opening it s the beginning of cracking his exterior to find out what he s really like I m SO excited for Half-Blood Prince because it has SO MUCH SNAPE 3Luna Lovegood her introduction to the series was basically one of my most anticipated parts of reading the books for the first time and it did NOT disappoint What I didn t expect was adoring Luna s movie version a lot more than the book version because the actress did an amazing job in showcasing Luna s strangeness with a lovableness that s sort of absent in the book I m very much obsessed with her character so reading about her was everything I wished for and more The end I don t really want to sit here and hash-out all my heartbreak because I would have to type for 500000 hours so I ll just say this it was one of the best literary work I ve ever read in my life The chapters throughout 36-38 were absolutely breathtaking and so tense it was an experience like no other J K Rowling continues to astound me AND THE DA KILLED IT Harry should be proud I m SO EXCITED TO CONTINUE WITH THIS SERIES but getting slightly concerned because I m almost done with it two more books And that s it No more Harry Potter I m going to go now before I lose it 3 more"

times Well if you re counting the one where you tripped over your own feet and knocked the wand out of my hand Like the fact that the person Sirius cared for the most about in the world was you said Dumbledore quietly He s not a child said Sirius impatiently He s not an adult either said Mrs Weasley the color rising in her cheeks He s not James Sirius I m perfectly clear who he is thanks Molly said Sirius coldly I m not sure you are said Mrs Weasley Sometimes the way you talk about him it s as though you think you ve got your best friend back In times of old when I was new And Hogwarts barely started The founders of our noble school Thought never to be parted United by a common goal They had the selfsame yearning To make the world s best magic school And pass along their learning Together we will build and teach The four good friends decided And never did they dream that they Might someday be divided For were there such friends anywhere As Slytherin and Gryffindor Unless it was the second pair Of Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw So how could it have gone so wrong How could such friendships fail Why I was there and so can tell The whole sad sorry tale Said Slytherin We ll teach just those Whose ancestry is purest Said Ravenclaw We ll teach those whose Intelligence is surest Said Gryffindor We ll teach all those With brave deeds to their name Said Hufflepuff I ll teach the lot And treat them just the same These differences caused little strife When first they came to light For each of the four founders had A House in which they might Take only those they wanted so For instance Slytherin Took only pure-blood wizards Of great cunning just like him And only those of sharpest mind Were taught by Ravenclaw While the bravest and the boldest Went to daring Gryffindor Good Hufflepuff she took the rest And taught them all she knew Thus the Houses and their founders Retained friendships firm and true So Hogwarts worked in harmony For several happy years But then discord crept among us Feeding on our faults and fears The Houses that like pillars four Had once held up our school Now turned upon each other and Divided sought to rule And for a while it seemed the school Must meet an early end What with dueling and with fighting And the clash of friend on friend And at last there came a morning When old Slytherin departed And though the fighting then died out He left us quite downhearted And never since the founders four Were whittled down to three Have the Houses been united As they once were meant to be And now the Sorting Hat is here And you all know the score I sort you into Houses Because that is what I m for But this year I ll go further Listen closely to my song Though condemned I am to split you Still I worry that it s wrong Though I must fulfill my duty And must quarter every year Still I wonder whether Sorting May not bring the end I fear Oh know the perils read the signs The warning history shows For our Hogwarts is in danger From external deadly foes And we must unite inside her Or we ll crumble from within I have told you I have warned you Let the Sorting now begin The hat became motionless once more more"

"218","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Feb 10 2018"," Roman Kurys","it was amazing"," It has been quite awhile since I finished HP s part 4 Over ten books as I take a look back at my reading history Felt like a right time to come back to the wizarding world of Rowling created I have read them all when they first came out but re-reading them now seems different somehow Maybe its all the books I have read since or maybe it s just me racking up a decade behind my belt First three books still felt very childish to me They do belong on children literature shelves not in a negative way just stating how I felt The fourth had more of a YA feel Goblet of Fire began departure from kid s shelf Order of the Phoenix to me was simply a great fantasy novel Much darker than previous installments and much better So far my favorite of the series pending re-reads of all the rest of course This book was long and I loved that fact It allowed me to immerse more and more into the world pretend that I was there I did not rush it I took my time enjoying every word and re-reading sentences that I liked It was a fantastic journey one I would not take a page shorter This book evokes emotion it is also pretty dark and moody unlike its predecessors Characters 4I loved character development this volume brought with it The fact that no one is perfect and everyone can and does make mistakes is apparent here I don t know if there is a clear hero of the story everyone is sort of riding the grey area very often I loved the development of Harry s crush on Cho Ron and Hermoine s romance brewing more and more volatile and Dumbledore actually showing some weaknesses I know Snape is everyone s favorite to hate on but I did not hate him His character grows so much more in this book We get the context that we lacked in the previous books Don t get me wrong I am not saying he s likable all of a sudden now He is not I do however understand that dark place he is coming from and I can sympathize Now Umbridge Sigh Hmm Die in a Fire That is all That is all I got Just go ahead and Die in a Fire As a side note Yes Still not liking Hermoine A pure definition of a buzz kill Just let the people be Go police your own behavior not mess it up for everyone else Although her sort of a leniency to Weasly brothers was refreshing And oh Weasley brothers oh yeah them They are fantastic Simply fantastic I wish I could just meet them in real life that would be nothing short of glorious They are my favorite supporting pair of characters especially in this book Now with Umbridge out of the way Harry somehow is my 2nd least favorite character here I actually begin to like Snape more than Harry I mean what a moody dumbass of a whiner How much thicker can you get Harry I hope he grows out of this weird phase he s in I really do Well enough about the characters This book is full of them and Rawling did a great job making them come alive to me Story 5Much more mature then anything before the story was fantastic Through every page and twist and curl I breathlessly anticipated the next page And then one after that and one after that one I did NOT want this book to end I yelled at Rowling for making this book only 900 pages I wanted it to be 99999 pages I did not want it to stop It was good very good nonstop page turning good out loud reading in different voices and having people on a subway in NYC staring at you weird kind of good Now it was not very full of surprises some plot twists of course but not anything that you would not see coming It wasn t that that makes this story shine It is its ups and downs it is a variety of characters and the inevitable doom that overhangs the wizarding world while the ministry remains in denial Word after word the tension built up gets crazy to the point where I was yelling at the pages telling them what to do Surely I know what they should do An emotional rollercoaster all the way through from the first until the last page of this too small volume Setting 5I seem to be getting my wish to learn more about the Ministry and its inner workings finally It does not disappoint I had been dying to catch a glimpse inside the ministry ever since Book 3 and oh boy was it great The usual already great set of a wizarding world became much more complex in this book Routine day to day life of wizards does not seem to be much different from the muggle s existence and it is fascinating in a way They have the ability to use MAGIC Something a lot of muggles are dying to be able to do yet they live normal lives much like we do They go to work they watch sports they read books and study And even when they begin to fight it is not very different from a gunfight except no need to reload Because MAGIC That pseudo-realism did a great job sucking me in Traditional fantasy stories in some other worlds take awhile to world build to make me understand the geography and how things work in that world and there is none of that here I am in my world except a bit hidden not the one I see yet one that is close enough to touch It was absolutely perfect Cannot wait until the next one Roman Ragnar more"

"222","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Aug 23 2011"," Katya","liked it"," Hello friends and welcome back to my reviews of the Harrietta Potter books sigh We got a bad one today folks I just don t mean bad I mean really really bad I ve often given many stars to horrible books as long as I liked the characters so it probably won t surprise you that I deduct from a rating when an MC annoys pisses me off Luckily that doesn t happen very often Only a handful of times really Bella Swan Luce Price Laurel Sewell Ever Bloom Nora Gray Bethany Church but dear oh dear I think there is a special place in this pantheon of horrible MCs for Harrietta Potter Truly not since Evermore have I encountered this much priviledge and first-world angst rolled into one big ball of Mary Sue Harrietta isn t just annoying and whiny - she is so laughingly short-sighted it s a miracle she is still alive Constantly fighting authority figures without a second thought of the consequences never listening to her well-meaning friends putting her petty feelings before the important missions she has to face - from beginning to end she is a twit through and through In one particularly stupid instance she gets her friends to risk their skin so that she can talk to a fugitive about the fact that her father was a huge douchebag I might have bought it if she was just your every-day fifteen year old girl but she isn t She s been in Hogwarts for four years faced death at thrice as many times if not more yet she hasn t drawn the simplest of conclusions How silly is that Shouldn t she have more sense Shouldn t she have learned by now to think before she acted Has she no sense of self-preservance Honestly if she were a boy I d have said she thought with her dick furious whispering What What do you mean that she is indeed a boy more whispering puts on glasses and reads the cover again Oh it s Harry not Harrietta I did wonder why she couldn t get into the girls dormitories Well in that case it s all fine Silly me Please disregard everything I said above this is surely a literary masterpiece that deserves a five star rating What jolly good fun So I was reading this book yesterday when this blogpost by Lindsay Ellis popped into my mind I ve already linked it before in a status update but I figured that I might just do it again because it s a really good post on female characters and the standards we hold up to them It came to mind while I was reading Order of the Phoenix because at one point I thought Merlin Harry TSTL much And then I paused TSTL Don t we usually apply that to female heroines And then my inner feminazi kicked me in the ass Note that s the Zuka Club from Ouran Hight School Host Club A very nice anime highly recommended Yes yes Potter fans I know it s ludicrous that above I compared Harry to Bella Swan And yeah I guess that maybe I was a bit harsh in my comment I mean it s not like Harry mopes rushes into stupid situations without thought does exactly what he shouldn t do and expect his friends to do everything for him Oh wait Well at least Bella is a couple of years older Nah I will go out on a limb and say this Harry Potter is not as bad as Twilight It s ludicrous to call it that For example most of the characters in the HP books are great and sympathetic read Neville and Snape In many instances they are the saving grace of this series Snape Snape Snape did I mention Snape The worldbuilding is awesome There are actual consequences to the stupid things the characters do The list goes on and on and on BUT I can t deny that Harry gets away with a lot of stupid stuff some stupid enough to outstage Bella s melodramatic dive in New Moon view spoiler Get this He sees Snape s memory of James Potter torturing him Gets mopey and decides to talk to Sirius but the only fireplace he can use is in Umbridge s office So he lets Fred and George cause mayham which gets them expelled so that he can go in there and talk about the fact that his dad was a bumrag when he was 15 He does this by the way even if Sirius gave him a safe means for two-way communication while Umbridge is just waiting to get him expelled and knowing that one false step can lead to the discovery of the order and Sirius immediate execution hide spoiler Had Harry been a girl we d have tripped over ourselves to call him TSTL and Mary Sue Why do you think Hermione is so likeable and relatable It s because she s a heroine and the fact that she isn t the titular character saves her mostly from scrutiny We really do hold up a higher standard for our female protagonists than we do for the men Why is that Is it because heroes are traditionally men and women somehow have to one-up them to prove themselves worthy Is it culture causing these presumptions Biology Social constraints Who knows Once again I don t deny the merits of the HP books In fact my friend Tamara wrote a my link post on that on the Lantern Hell HP7 is the only book I ve seen getting people to camp out to get or at least to preorder in Bulgaria I love the world of magic Rowling creates and what a rich wonderful secondary cast there is But this whole world revolves around a whiny fifteen-year old that relies on coincidences and a little help from his friends to battle villains that are more cartoons than actual threatening characters I mean seriously Umbridge She s so ridiculous I m surprised they haven t used her as a spell against boggarts Even Lord Voldemort while creepy in his own right doesn t seem to live up to all the buildup there is to his return in the first four books Will Harry always be the hero unquestioned simply because he s a dude more"
"223","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Apr 24 2010"," Yoana","it was amazing"," This book held my hand in a period of intense crisis and helped me settle into a screamingly new environment by reminding me of what I knew as Normal and possibly keeping me sane This might make it the most important book in my life 2016 reread SPOILERS GALORE BELOW Harry Potter and the Inexplicably Incompetent and Short-sighted or Else Unbelievably Manipulative Headmaster Who s Supposed to be Looking Out for Him would be a more accurate title Poor Harry he really does not have a single responsible adult in his life well except Molly and he never heeds her advice anyway Some random thoughts that occurred to me in the course of this reread below Reading about St Mungo s I have a number of questions I don t remember occurring to me before for example what do wizards do when they get a non-magical illness like smallpox or pneumonia seeing as Healers seem to only treat magical maladies Judging by Ron s reaction to doctors those Muggle nutter that cut people up and the general poor understanding of the Muggle world among pure-blood families they don t have a habit of turning to Muggle medicine which would mean they have magical means for dealing with those which poses an ethical issue if they can treat Muggle diseases aren t they obligated to share this knowledge with Muggles their fellow human beings There s even a specific example in the text Arthur takes a Blood Replenishing Potion to treat his non-stop bleeding after the bite I feel like this should definitely be something ethics would require them to share with everyone especially considering the need for blood in the Muggle world it would make the need for blood donations obsolete This should be called Harry Potter The Ungrateful Little Shit I d forgotten what an obnoxious brat he is throughout this book and what a low opinion he has of his friends If it wasn t for his supreme affection and loyalty to Neville exhibited in the heartbreaking St Mungo s scene which made me cry again I d have hated his guts by the last quarter of the book It also illuminated for me just how much Harry underappreciates Hermione without whom he d have been dead at 11 not to mention failed all his exams and sent back to the Muggle world She deserves much much more recognition than he gives her which is barely any And the same goes for Ron Speaking of Hermione another thing I notice clearly now that for some reason hadn t struck me that much before is just how ruthless she is It s one of the things I love most about her tbh She keeps a women unemployed with blackmail and then forces her to do her job for free I ll be honest this is skirting the line even for me the most diehard fan of Hermione it s not only illegal though Hermione has proven before she only cares for those rules that jive with her inner moral compass it s pretty cruel It makes you think just how much JKR loathes tabloid journalists But it doesn t stop there this is also the book where 16-year-old Hermione disobeys a teacher a first for her starts an illegal organisation in direct defiance of said teacher and the law manipulates marginalised creatures over whom she has enormous privilege to further her political agenda good thing she grows out of that eventually and inflicts a permanent yes as in lifelong facial disfigurement to traitors She d make one fearsome dictator if she were into power it s a good thing she s not Found another inconsistency if you can listen in on other people s conversations in Pensieve memories even when the person whose memory it is didn t hear it at the time means any secret can be revealed if you found someone who was at the vicinity of its sharing at the time and ask them to extract the memory Anyone could have known Remus was a werewolf for example if they were on the grounds that day and the entire school was if they just entered their memory and went close enough to the Marauders I have to say the oft-repeated criticism that the DE couldn t handle a bunch of teenagers is not true they could and did They had them all defeated and Harry with the unscathed prophecy cornered when the Order and the Aurors arrived and it was only after Dumbledore turned up that they were finally subdued they had managed to murder Sirius and incapacitate Tonks and were well on their way to escape before that more"

"227","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Nov 10 2010"," Emily","really liked it"," I have grown to appreciate this book over time and I think I enjoyed it the most on this reread I become fonder and fonder of CAPSLOCK HARRY as I grow older When I was a teen reading this book I remember rolling my eyes a little bit at him - why couldn t he just get on with it - but since I was a teenager who should have been classified in the angstiest possible category perhaps I needed the distance So I love a lot of things about this book in particular Harry s temper and its beautiful match-ups with Umbridge The D A and the Room of Requirement are also standouts But alas the overall plot is the weakest so far and this book is simply too long While I could read hundreds and hundreds of pages more on Harry Potter I have also come to appreciate just how much better the economical Potter books particularly PoA are There s a world in which an editor removed Grawp from this edition and no one suffered least of all Hagrid And I have quibbles with some of the character choices particularly with view spoiler Arthur Weasley - just kill him completely ALL FATHER FIGURES MUST GO hide spoiler I remember being extremely disappointed when the prophecy was revealed - it s obvious isn t it - but the plot intricacies that the prophecy sets up view spoiler primarily Snape hide spoiler pay off The battle with the Death Eaters at the Ministry has never felt particularly right to me either given that Harry and his friends are all 15 and the Death Eaters are presumably halfway competent But the usual wrap-up conversation with Harry and Dumbledore is great And as explored in a lengthy Twitter DM lol conversation with Kali and Liz over the weekend elements of these books really do become more horrifying over time I am officially older than all of the Cool Adults Bill and company and the Order of the Phoenix seems to have been made up solely of eighteen-year-olds running around getting themselves murdered And of course the detentions with Umbridge are insane I watched the first half of this movie this week before realizing that I ve never watched it again because it s you know terrible and it doesn t even halfway capture the Harry Umbridge relationship more"

"239","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Apr 11 2018"," Sasagawa","it was amazing"," Without further ado here are my thoughts this is a lengthy piece sorry folks The Order of the Phoenix for me had a major paradigm shift The themes were no longer carefree and childish albeit there was still a slight carefree undertone but that made the book ten times better I was able to enjoy the carefree undertone and simultaneously experience a new paradigm This new paradigm was dark and unadulterated There was a lot of character development and some additional characters Some I liked others I loathed vehemently Starting with the current trio Harry tried to be reasonable throughout the story everyone repeatedly kept shutting him out when clearly he was to be told He reacted very sourly callous to some but to me circumstantially very appropriate but only with the higher ups not with his peers He had a right to meticulous information Now time for the pure one Hermione She was a star as usual quirky fastidious passionate and the schemer I ve come to like her character more How Malfoy keeps calling Hermione a Mudblood is beyond me she s got a pure heart and the noblest characteristics out of all her peers Malfoy is just a dry simplistic turd As for Ron you can say he was being very supportive and his usual funny self I am very fond of his and Hermione s discourses And now a couple of additional characters Luna Lovegood she came across slightly abnormal but then she exhibited her best attempts to help her friends even trying to make them happy particularly Harry whom majority of the time is an ungrateful prat Now a character I loathed vehemently yes you ve guessed it it s Umbridge or Umb nevermind from The Ministry of Muppets What can be said about her is the following she s a judge a book by its cover type of woman looks like a frog and is slimy like one too In its replete sense Throughout this entire book her unequivocal aim was to overthrow Dumbledore and make his closest associates lives hell She even attempted savagery on Snape yes Snape 0 0 you know someone s crazy when they re evil and they can t side with Snape Speaking of Snape I feel bad slightly I just didn t know I m still confused how I m meant to feel about him he s just misunderstood I guess I ll have to see more of his youthful years for me to ascertain an educated opinion of his character Honourable mentions Phineas Negullus is a wicked character in the good sense the mighty morphin power rangers to the rescue Sirius Red my dear man Lupin Black Moody Blue Tonks Yellow and Kingsley Pink cos he s done jack diddly squat Lastly the Weasley twins they are basically homies my boys broskis I can relate to them a lot We re just on the same wavelength ------------------------------------------------------------------------------Here s an extract from the book and my commentary below each point Don t read it it s boring the review has officially ended a long way up but you may if you insist Hermione looked very shocked But you ll get into trouble Not until Montague reappears and that could take weeks I dunno where we sent him said Fred coolly Anyway we ve decided we don t care about getting into trouble any more Have you ever asked Hermione Course we have said George Never been expelled have we Me in highschool too calculated to be expelled We ve always known where to draw the line said Fred My attendance dipped to 85 momentarily I quickly shot it up to 94 which was extremely irksome as I wanted to attend a 6th form college they had a strict policy of good attendance as a prerequisite for an application later followed by University yes I had some thoughts of education D I would also once a week nearly every week skip first period Math or English whichever I felt like under no guise whatsoever I just knew the school policy to a T the concession was once a week you are allowed to be late never on an assembly day which was Wednesdays I still remember it s been 8 years D and never after first period I d come 09 45am into school and stroll into class like a silly goon Oh and if I was late on a Wednesday morning assembly I figured out that if I waited till first period began and then entered school I would be late to first period and not to the actual assembly thus dodging detention altogether D We might have put a toe across it occasionally said George Had a few spontaneous scuffles two were spectated by teachers others went unnoticed I had my reasons D I wasn t a bully that I loathed never picked on the weak so I have no regrets I just defended myself and had a solid reason for my poor conduct But we ve always stopped short of causing real mayhem said Fred I knew my boundaries my mother mind you is very much

"240","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Apr 07 2017"," Ilse","really liked it"," Para empezar debo decir que de todos los libros de HP este es el que menos me gusta y para variar es el mas anchote aunque no me mal interpreten me gusta el libro pero comparado con como me gustan los otros pues este se queda algo corto en fin el libro es bueno pero a lo mejor el motivo de que no me guste tanto se debe a que este es un poco m s lento que sus compa eros de saga y como casi tiene 900 hojas pues es mas el tiempo que te tiene de esta manera El caso es que es medio lento en la primera mitad ya despu s de haber cruzado esta linea la historia se pone muy buena tanto que ni siquiera te das cuenta como vas pasando las hojas en fin se te va muy r pido la lectura En fin de eso no es de lo que quer a hablar ahora si no de algo que aun despu s de varios a os me pone triste y como se que casi en su totalidad la poblaci n del mundo conoce HP creo que puedo hablar con sopilers as que Aun no puedo aceptar que Rowling haya matado a Sirius osea se me hace de las cosas mas crueles que haya escrito y es que pobre Harry para l Sirius era lo mas cercano a un padre realmente hubiera deseado que JK no lo hubiera matado ya no por mi bien si no por el de Harry ah vivido tantas desagradables cosas que la verdad es que este suceso solo vino a empeorar mas su felicidad creo que de todas las dem s muertes esta es una de las que mas me duelen por que como dije Sirius era lo mas cercano a un padre para Potter y solo pudo disfrutar de eso por un tiempo muy reducido pero en fin no vale la pena ahogarse siempre en el mismo vaso de agua aunque duela Y por ltimo como ya tenia bastante tiempo que hab a le do este tomo hab a olvidado lo despreciable que es Umbridge en serio creo que es el nico personaje que eh leido hasta la fecha que en serio es super despreciable y en serio la llegas a Odiar y el caso es que no es TAN mala Voldemort pero si le gana y por mucho en ser mas mucho mas desagradable que l En fin ese un muy buen punto para la escritora por que en serio nunca eh le do a un personaje mas vil que el de la madame subsecretaria more"
"241","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Jun 02 2013"," Connie","it was ok"," Blargh 2 5 When I mentioned that I was rereading the Harry Potter series two separate people told me that the 5th book was their least favorite I was confused I mean there s the Order of the Phoenix right That s cool There are Sirius Lupin and Tonks and Grimmauld Place--and that old creepy house is neat Getting a window into Sirius s past is some much needed depth and the kids are growing up Upon a second reading I utterly agree the 5th book is my least favorite so far by quite a bit In a way I the things that bugged me about this book are actually things that probably add a little bit of depth or complexity to it At the same time I don t read Harry Potter for either depth or complexity I read Harry Potter because it s fun The 5th book isn t fun it s annoying I challenge anyone to re-read it and disagree Spoilers ahead 1 TEEN ANGST EVERYWHERE FOR THE ENTIRE BOOK I guess I kind of forgot about it Either that or when I was an angsty teen myself reading about Angsty Teens didn t stick out as noteworthy In this book it drove me bonkers Harry pretty much spends the entire book shouting at Hermione and Ron and being downright trollish toward Cho No amount of trauma in the 4th book can make up for an entire year of jerkdom And Hermione and Ron bicker for the entire book Ugh I know that to a certain extent this is realistic but it s just not very fun to read about 2 The Ministry of Magic--They re emulating the GOP here seriously The Ministry reminded me way too much of politics to give me any remote enjoyment from that part of the book which was a significant part I completely forgot about the fact that 1 despite significant evidence to the contrary ahem climate change the ministry completely ignores the evidence that Voldemort is back because it would be inconvenient 2 they then commence a successful slur campaign on anyone who says otherwise 3 they actively stifle and make illegal any possibly discussion of Voldemort s return 4 they take away crazy amounts of power from anyone who dares to argue and 5 they re just jerks 3 Umbridge I think she s a good foil to mess up Hogwarts but she was just too overblown the crazy things she did were just so over the top that I couldn t take her or much of the book remotely seriously Though the one over-the-top thing that I did enjoy was her quill of doom--making the kids write lines in their own blood is pretty deliciously nasty 4 Weird and bizarre decision making from Dumbledore and the Order Let s take a highly paraphrased example from the book Harry Dude I just had a dream where I WAS VOLDEMORT S SNAKE And I it attacked Arthur Weasley And it was all true Person In Charge You should really take Occlumency Harry Person In Charge We don t want you seeing what Voldemort sees We want you to shield your brain Oh yeah since Dumbledore doesn t want to have anything to do with you you re going to take lessons with Snape because that s going to go really well I m sure you two will get over your differences and have great one on one occlumency lessons Harry But wouldn t it be useful to see what Voldemort sees Like a weapon or something Person In Charge Mind your elders and make sure you practice your Occlumency we don t want you seeing anything Harry Wha At that point why the heck wouldn t you tell Harry Oh and PS--if you can t shield your mind Voldemort may be able to send you false visions and or take over your body this should give you incentive to practice Though in fairness to Person In Charge--Harry especially with the constant companionship of Hermione should have figured that one out 5 Instead the whole climax scene of the book is ridiculously contrived Voldemort sends Harry a trick message so Harry and Co go investigating and do a lot of really dumb things along the way They eventually manage to bungle their way through an attack by 15 death eaters and stay alive long enough for the order to arrive The whole lead up to the end scene is equally ridiculous First and my biggest pet peeve of the whole book is that Sirius gives Harry a mirror that is a safe way for the two of them to communicate but Harry forgets to open the package so instead tries to check on Sirius by floo powder and gets tricked by Kreacher and caught by Umbridge After getting captured by Umbridge a ridiculous scene ensues where Harry Hermione lead Umbridge into the Forbidden Forest and feed Umbridge to the centaurs The centaurs attack Harry and Hermione and then are attacked in turn by Hagrid s half brother the troll who just happens to have gotten loose Magically in the middle of the Forest Ron Ginny Luna and Neville catch up with Harry and Hermione then they all ride invisible ish magic horses to the Ministry of Magic where more mayhem ensues 6 I did like the fact that a we learn a bit more about Neville and his parents b the fact that Neville finally starts to prove himself c this time around I actually really enjoyed Luna and d Ginny s actually ok I thought she was a wet rag the first time I read the series and couldn t understand what Harry ever saw in her--but there are actually little tidbits scattered throughout the book that make me kind of like Ginny 7 Cho Ugh Teen angsty romance with an utterly personality-less love-interest Though one of my favorite scenes of the book was after Harry and Cho s date implodes and Harry tells Hermione about it she explains how Harry should have insulted her and called her ugly when talking to Cho--it was actually rather sweet 8 The payback at the end of the book was minimal at best The upshot of the entire book Voldemort s attempt to get the prophecy is that Harry and Voldemort eventually have to fight and only one of them will come out of it alive Uhh who couldn t have predicted it Also since the prophecy was given to Dumbledore shouldn t he at some point in the book have passed along the message to Harry Yes in a 20ish page monologue at the end of the book Dumbledore talks about all his mistakes but they re pretty big for someone who is supposed to be brilliant and I feel like much of the book was written around the monologue not the other way around Whew and I planned for this to be a short review Whoops more"

"269","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Oct 05 2015"," leynes","it was amazing"," What can I say This is my all time favorite Harry Potter book Probably my all time favorite book-book that isn t a classic even though it kinda is right And funnily enough Order has always been my favorite ever since I discovered as a 11 year old that my German copy of it had over 1000 pages 1024 pages to be exact D and I felt sooooooo accomplished by reading a book with over 1000 pages and getting it and loving it The reason why Order is so precious to me is because in this one I got the best examination of Hogwarts as a school and how deep the bond between students students and teachers and their sense of belonging to the Wizarding Comunity is In my opinion the real villain in this wasn t Lord Voldermort but Dolores Umbridge I loved that she was a threat INSIDE OF HOGWARTS and therefore made the students feel afraid and uncomfortable within bounds that used to be the most safest and comforting I loved how the whole school united to take her down except for some Slytherins but oh well JKR really needed to keep that stereotype right smh I laughed tears when we got to the scene in which Umbridge is punishing Harry constantly because he did the Quibbler interview about how the Dark Lord is returning and Fudge is telling lies And all the other teachers want to show Harry their support and so Madame Sprout awards Gryffindor 20 points because HARRY PASSED HER A FUCKING WATERING CAN or Flitwick secretly slips him sweets after his lessons and Trewlaney sees in the future that Harry would live to ripe old age and become Minister for Magic I couldn t man it was sooooo fucking perfect It made me furiously happy I also really loved the way Luna was introduced and what she brought to the story Because she is kind of an outcast and a nutter but at the same time she is portrayed in such a way that you as a reader really get to see how clever and right she is about things And her loyalty to Harry gets me every time That she actually flew with the crew to the Ministry of Magic is just a crazy act of bravery because she literally only got to know Harry Co half a year ago this girl man I love her so much A lot of people think that Order is the worst in the series because Harry is so moody in this one To people who firmly believe that all I can say is FUCK YOU Well that is a little harsh but I have so much compassion when it comes to Harry I feel so much protectiveness and I hate it when people give him shit Harry fucking Potter was abused since he was a toddler in the most nastiest way by his uncle aunt and cousin and he fucking remained a good person and didn t turn bitter or all psycho He is the most humble character that I know and honestly sooo pure and innocent He is used as a chess piece by Dumbledore but is still willing to sacrifice himself for the greater good and he is just my little baby and if you re coming for him I WILL FIGHT YOU Of course he is fucking moody in Order First and foremost HE IS A FRIGGIN TEENAGER and teenagers ARE MOODY get over it and he feels fucking left out because Dumbledore is purposefully leaving him in the dark and he is just confused as fuck He feels enstranged from his friends and all the other students from Hogwarts because the fucking News are reporting about him and what a lying little shit he is DAILY How do you deal with that Then we have the little shit Umbridge who is tormenting him more than any other student and if I were Harry I would be just as fucking moody as him He has every right to be The whole Sirius situation is also quite tragic Sirius isn t my favorite character because he is so manipulative and basically causing a deeper drift between Harry and his friends But on the other hand I understand Sirius behaviour to the fullest because for him Harry equals James his best friend he lost in a fucking tragic way probs still blaming himself for his death and on top of that he was held captive in Azkaban for 13 friggin years thanks for nothing Dumbledore you little shit and his mind was just bound to be fucked because of this So the whole Sirius situation is rather complex and I feel compassion for him -

"271","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Jul 22 2015"," Rebecca whymermaids","it was amazing"," So angsty and full of angry teenage emotions Coming off Goblet of Fire Order of the Phoenix is slated to be dark and full of emotional turmoil Harry has after all just narrowly escaped death once more witnessed the return of Voldemort and watched one of his classmates die He is also only believed by a handful of people and so is publicly ridiculed On top of that he s a fifteen year old boy who feels mollycoddled and is in the pains of growing up and feeling misunderstood Order of the Phoenix was destined to be a hostile book Then there s the ever-growing presence and threat of the Ministry of Magic who is too afraid to believe Harry and Dumbledore and has it out for both of them There are ridiculous Educational Decrees forcing the government into education where it is not wanted or needed and a new Ministry official in a teaching role - never a good idea Dolores Umbridge is an absolute terror of a woman She is evil spiteful condescending and a villain but a villain in the most realistic sense While Voldemort reigns as the series main baddie Umbridge is the kind of villain Muggles encounter on a regular basis the kind rooted in the greed and lust for power in government brainwashing and most of us have encountered or will encounter someone like her in our own lives though maybe not to the same extent She is the kind of person who is too caught up in herself and her beliefs that she is blind to the opinions and truths of others especially if they contradict her own As my first rereading since picking up the profession of teaching I hated Umbridge even more The way she treats the students as if their opinions don t matter and they cannot possibly know more than her and the way she treats her fellow teachers as if she who has been teaching for mere weeks is better than they are is appalling I don t blame Harry and the others for losing their temper with her because I was doing so on my couch as well It is also such a great parallel to education today how government officials who have never set foot inside a classroom think they know more about teaching than the teachers who are there everyday interacting with and forging relationships with the students How a test matters more than whether or not the student has actually learned I was shaking in fury Of the seven books this is the hardest to read simply because of the emotional turmoil Harry is going through It s his worst year at Hogwarts yet and it seems like all his happiness is slowly being sucked away as if a Dementor were following him around It is hard to read him lash out as his friends and everyone who loves him it is hard to watch him experience even more pain it is hard to witness his loss and anger We feel as Dumbledore does and it is hard I just want to take Harry and wrap him up in a big hug make him some tea and tell him everything will be okay At the same time I want to smack him because he doesn t listen to anyone He s hotheaded and rash but that s who he is This is also one of the funnier books despite the darkness beginning to swirl around them Fred and George are at their best and I loved seeing Harry take charge of the D A Ron take over as Keeper for the Gryffindor Quidditch team and Hermione continue to pursue her justice for house elves while stressing out about exams in the process As the core characters grow we re also introduced to wonderful new characters Luna Tonks Kingsley and get to see some of our favorite side characters with more to do This book also starts to touch more on the social issues than the others as it deals more with the rights for house elves but it also talks more about the injustice and discrimination of half-breeds a continuation of the discrimination of half-bloods and muggle-borns Umbridge s hostile opinions of half-breeds mirror those of people in the muggle world regarding race gender age etc and the way the Ministry ignores the return of Voldemort and the Daily Prophet prints only what the government wants says a lot about our society The longest book in the series there s a lot going on in the Order of the Phoenix There s a heartbreaking death some laughs blinding anger and a bit of love and warmth It s not an easy read but it s one of the best in the series more"

"273","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Aug 13 2016"," Rikke","it was ok"," This is the hard one This is the longest Harry Potter-novel and it is the hardest one to finish Its many pages doesn t work in its favor I remember my sister giving up on it even though she had loved the series so far She simply couldn t make it past the angry main character screaming in Caps Lock the long summer without answers and the many discussions of politics She wanted to read about Hogwarts about spells magical creatures and adventures And she wasn t the only one The main problem is the pace This book paves the way for book 6 and 7 And while I appreciate Rowling taking her time to build up her finale it doesn t work for me at all This book is filled with more questions than answers and most famously I hate the way the thestrals were handled view spoiler Thestrals can only be seen by someone who has watched someone die One could argue that Harry should be able to see them from the get-go but Rowling has made it clear that he didn t fully comprehend what was happening to his parents as he was only a toddler and therefore wasn t able to see thestrals However all that changes when he watched Cedric die in book four But shouldn t he then be able to see the thestrals when he leaves the school in book four Apparently not Rowling says If Harry had seen them then and we hadn t explained them then I thought that would be rather a cheat on the reader in that Harry suddenly sees these monsters but we don t go anywhere with them so to explain to myself I said that you had to have seen the death and allowed it to sink in a little bit before slowly these creatures became solid in front of you The thestrals are a product of convinience Rowling made up the clumsy rules which are never fully explained in the books leaving many readers puzzled because she didn t want to explain the thestrals in the ending of a book The solution she came up with is far from elegant it is so contrived making you extremely aware of the writer behind the book pulling the strings and arranging the words in order to make the story flow nicely hide spoiler While I understand why Harry is angry and while I understand why he needs to be isolated I feel like Sirius was done a major injustice in this book His restlessness is of course understandable but his need to encourage Harry to trouble and danger is so unlike him Sirius spent the entirety of book four warning Harry about upcoming dangers urging him to be selfish and only focusing on getting safely out of the tournament But in this book Sirius suddenly becomes irresponsible urging Harry to act out instead of being safe Why The man spent half of his lifetime in Azkaban I would think he had learned some patience Instead a few months in hiding turns him into a madman This book suffers from its length and from Harry s isolation It becomes quite tiresome though I of course always loved the idea of Dumbledore s Army as a way for the younger generation to mimic the Order of the Phoenix more"

"300","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"," Oct 07 2016"," Eric Allen","it was ok"," I really should just make myself go and finish the last 70 pages or so of the painfully dull Empire of Storms by Sarah J Maas but I m on a roll with Harry Potter rereads so meh Here s a funny story about this book When It came out back in 2003 I bought a copy of it on my way to a family reunion camping trip Once I arrived all of my little cousins absolutely flipped that I actually had the book and brought it with me that they refused to quit bothering me until I read it to them So over that week I read the entire book to a group of 10-12 cousins between the ages of 6-10 or so I have a very large extended family and quite a few cousins I ve never even met some of them and I ll be damned if I can remember how many of them there are or even what all their names are Anyway as I was reading this book to them I got the the part where Hagrid returns to Hogwarts and this is completely true and rather hilarious The moment I read the words Hagrid s back every single one of those children either groaned or sighed EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM If you can t tell I don t really like Hagrid and well apparently I m not the only one I like him in the first two books but as soon as he started teaching and bringing bigger and stupider subplots into the mix he really started grating on me Anyway I remember enjoying this book but not as much as the others in the series However as I reread it this time I came to a bit of a realization I really really don t like this book I mean I REALLY don t like it So I m going to list a few of the things that I feel were poorly done with it and why I feel that they were poorly done I wasn t planning to give much criticism to this series because for what it is it s rather entertaining fun and generally well put together But man this book I kind of need to vent about it for a bit There are several things that are very wrong with this book and with the characters Here s a list 1 Harry is a miserable little shit 2 All tension and drama in the story is artificially forced 3 Every single character in this entire book is an absolute idiot 4 Hagrid see above story 5 Very large plot holes inconsistency with the rest of the series 6 Harry is a miserable little shit So okay I ve talked with people about this book and a lot of them seem to really like it I bring up that I felt Harry was a miserable little shit and they tell me oh but he s a teenager that s how teenagers act Well yes It is in general HOWEVER Harry is not actually a teenager because he doesn t actually exist He is a character in a story He is the protagonist the hero the one we re all supposed to be rooting for and who we re supposed to sympathize with and identify with I understand that he s acting something like an actual teenager BUT as the hero of the story HE STILL HAS TO REMAIN LIKABLE AND SYMPATHETIC And well he s not He s a miserable little shit He spends the entire book treating all of his friends and loved ones like garbage whining complaining yelling at people he cares about and generally being a miserable little shit because of really stupid and selfish reasons I m supposed to sympathize with him while he s doing that He never even apologizes to anyone about it or thanks anyone for trying to help him He s being a spoiled little brat throughout the majority of this book and he never does anything even remotely sympathetic or likable to make up for it Honestly after all the mouthing off he does in this book he kind of does deserve a lot of the bad things that happen to him his detentions his ban from Quidditch etc etc etc He brought those on himself because he was being a miserable little shit instead of using his brain and making the best of his situation All of the tension and drama in this book are sooooooo fake and forced This is one of my pet peeves in writing Every single shred of tension could be resolved in this book if any character had just explained what was happening and why and why he was not to be allowed into sensitive things to Harry in the beginning There would be no drama at all Harry would likely have understood and been a lot less of a miserable little shit and that s that I hate it when authors try to force drama into a story through a lack of communication FOR ABSOLUTELY NO GOOD REASON AT ALL It comes off as very contrived Drama that feels forced doesn t feel dramatic Have someone explain to Harry what s happening and why at the beginning and then let the drama come more naturally as he feels left out because of it understanding but still wanting to help and not being able to You could draw a huge parallel between him and Sirius Black as they re in similar situations and it really could have been a huge bonding point between them giving Black s death a lot more impact than the zero it had in this book because the author forgot to give me any reason to care about him before killing him off And then Harry could put all of his frustrations with being useless into forming the DA and standing up to Umbridge because it s the only thing he can do There are so many better ways of creating tension and drama in this situation other than characters being assholes to Harry and refusing to give him any information He s a teenager that has previously shown himself incapable of ignoring a mystery What the hell did they think was going to happen see point 3 And again all Sirius had to do was tell Harry what the gift he gave him for christmas was and what it was used for on any number of occasions and everything would have turned out perfectly fine for pretty much everyone Again the author is forcing drama into the story through a lack of communication It annoys me sooooooo much when authors do that It feels so fake A lot of people I ve talked with about this book use this as an excuse for Harry s behavior in this book but again the drama with Harry being a miserable little shit IS ARTIFICIALLY FORCED BY A CONTRIVED LACK OF COMMUNICATION And this point of every character in this book being an idiot ties in heavily with the previous one Everyone does the stupidest thing that they can possibly do in every situation that arises in this book Seriously EVERY SINGLE ONE Examples Well you ve already got two right there Hagrid bringing a giant to Hogwarts Voldemort showing up at the ministry nine pages after it was said that to go there in person would be extremely stupid of him Dumbledore s distancing himself from Harry Just about everything Sirius Black does in the entire book Every single decision that went into the whole Occlumency or however you spell it thing I mean really you put Harry with a teacher that he absolutely hates and who absolutely hates him and you expect him to learn anything from him or him to teach in a way that he s going to learn Harry and Fred and George allowing Malfoy to provoke them when they rarely have in the past All of these things and more go into this point Every character in this book acts like a completely idiot ALL OF THE TIME Hagrid s side story in this book is just sooooooooo boring and stupid I get that the guy doesn t have the best track record with dangerous creatures in the past but this one seems really over the top even for him And it s so out of place in this book as well It really has no point or purpose and goes nowhere And it s just cringe-inducingly stupid on top of that Did I mention what a miserable little shit Harry is in this book Okay every book in this series seems to have been written with no idea what comes next and ignores everything that came before it that is inconvenient to itself But man this one is in a league of it s on on continuity errors with the rest of the series You ve got the small ones like Prefects can t take points except that Percy already showed that they can back in book 2 I believe And then you go for the massive story shatteringly large ones Oh like why would Voldemort set up this elaborate scheme to get his hands on a prophecy that he had no reason to believe continued on past what was reported to him He already knew what it said He thought he knew the entire thing He murdered Harry s parents because of it Soooooooo why is he trying to get his hands on a prophecy that he already knows Because then this book would be about nothing Oh wait Or why would Voldemort come to the ministry in person for any reason when the entire reason behind the stupidly elaborate plot to retrieve the prophecy that he already thinks he knows in its entirety was because he couldn t show up at the ministry and reveal himself in the first place There are more but those are the biggest and worst ones that come to mind I feel a little bad thrashing this book because I remember seeing an interview with J K Rowling just after it came out When she wrote this book the pressure of how popular the series was becoming was really starting to get to her Millions of fans were demanding the next book Her publishers were demanding the next book And she was so stressed out over it that she literally could not make herself write it She was absolutely terrified of messing it up and had a lot of problems with writer s block She even purposely broke one of her hands with a hammer just so that she could have an actual visible excuse that she could show people on why she wasn t working on the next book I feel for her I really do I can t even imagine the pressure she must have been under while writing this book But it s still the worst book in the series by far and it still has a huge mess of problems with it that kept me from enjoying it I can be sympathetic to her situation while writing it but I m not going to call the book a masterpiece when it s not because of it And fun fact Firefox s built in spellchecker recognizes Voldemort Dumbledore Hogwarts and Sirius as actual words Did I mention what a miserable little shit Harry is in this book Anyway this book unfortunately is a crucial part of the story and cannot be skipped without missing a lot that isn t readily explained in the next book I feel that it really is the worst book in the series and I had a pretty miserable time forcing myself through it this last time Of course there are six other books in the series that are excellent so don t let one bad book in the middle throw you off the whole series The rest of the series is really fun and entertaining It s just this one that s not very good Honestly this is one of those very few times where I feel that the movie is actually better than the book Harry is made a lot less angsty and a lot more sympathetic in the movie and a lot of the continuity errors with other books in the series are removed or glossed over in such a way that they re irrelevant And Hagrid s side story is cut down to a far less annoying length more"
