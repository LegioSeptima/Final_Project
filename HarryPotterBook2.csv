"4","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Nov 25 2012"," Khanh first of her name mother of bunnies","it was amazing"," I love this book of course I do but the fact remains that this book prominently featured two of my most hated Harry Potter characters Ginny Weasley and Dobby There I said it I hate them both In my Harry Potter hate list Ginny and Dobby probably rank somewhere below Umbridge and Peter Pettigrew Yeah you heard me I hate them that much The reason I hate Ginny is---well never mind I don t want to start another shipping war here the last one was terrible enough so let the reason for my hatred be implicit and unsaid Dobby is freaking annoying yo All his eagerness and shit - and yeah I know what happens in the end Doesn t matter I still hate Dobby Dobby is the equivalent of fingernails on chalkboard for me If he had been my elf I d have given him a sock already so he could his whimpering sniveling ass out of my life He means well I know he does it s just that he s such a frustratingly well-meaning bumbling idiot You know what Harry If he doesn t stop trying to save your life he s going to kill you Aaaaaaaand one final note Ginny said Mr Weasley flabbergasted Haven t I taught you anything What have I always told you Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can t see where it keeps its brain No particular reason I included that except for the fact that it reminded me of my ex-boyfriend 3 more"

"6","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Nov 30 2017"," Chelsea Humphrey","it was amazing"," It is our choices Harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities What can I say that hasn t been said before about this series What words can do this book justice I ve felt at a loss on how to explain my feelings for these books as I ve read them I didn t experience them as a child and therefore my experience is clearly different than most others on here but in some ways I think it s just as magical to read these for the first time as an adult as it was for everyone who devoured these as they were published in their childhood I have kids so I was constantly wondering how my 5 year old will accept these books when she s a bit older and tried to view the story through her eyes The holidays are always a busy stressful time for us All of our family is a hefty distance to travel to and on top of that we re moving into our new place this month All I could think about was how desperately I wanted to escape all of my adult responsibilities for just a bit each day and this was the perfect book to do so with No matter your age the magical world of Hogwarts is truly spectacular the characters are such that they stay with you even after the final page is turned and the writing takes you back to a place you weren t sure existed for us old farts anymore If you have been hiding under a rock for the past 20 years like I have I highly encourage you pick these books up and get swept away like I did Time is a precious commodity these days and you couldn t spend it in a better way than with these precious kiddos more"
"7","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Apr 02 2015"," Kai","it was amazing"," I ll be in my bedroom making no noise and pretending I m not there -Me reading Harry PotterTo say it with the words of my 7 year old brother It was good but badder than the first book This is Harry Potter Nothing can ever beat a Harry Potter book Apart from another Harry Potter book And in this 7 and a half part series this is my least favourite book There s just so many things I don t like reading about Harry and Ron stealing the car and flying it to Hogwarts Gilderoy Lockhart Nah I could happily go without it But then there s things that are just brilliant The Valentines dwarf singing Harry a love song Hermione Granger being a genius through and through Fawkes Unwillingly funny Moaning Myrtle I think one of the reasons this may be the weakest part of the series is that it resembles Part One so much Someone tries to hurt Harry during Quidditch there s a hidden chamber deep underneath Hogwarts and Harry has to face Voldemort in said chamber Now you have to understand that there is nothing I love more than Harry Potter and this book is one of the most brilliant things ever written I m a proud Potterhead and Gryffindor and will forever love this world Always Find more of my books on Instagram more"

"12","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Feb 23 2016"," James Trevino","it was amazing"," I am always surprised by J K Rowling s ability to make her books an allegory of our modern world and it s big and hideous problems We all know after all that she covered discrimination wars hate crime the Kardashians etc Let s take this book for example Harry goes back to Hogwarts Now enter Gilderoy Lockhart A fame enamored charlatan who knows nothing about anything except memory spells So clearly a Kardashian Now some might ask do Kardashians know memory spells And the answer is clearly YES Keeping Up with the Kardashians is already on Season 13 so some magic must be at work otherwise you d have to think the world has gone mad Carrying on Harry has an awful year mostly because of the fact that he can talk snake language Actually all of Harry s life is an allegory about fame and how it can easily destroy you hence Harry might ve been modeled after Lindsay Lohan But Rowling had to give a moral to the story and because of that Harry ended up fine in the end mostly And to crown all of this awful year he meets Tom Riddle who is the heir of Slytherin He also speaks snake language and has a giant serpent for a pet So definitely a forefather of Taylor Swift And look at what that those family ties made her do Lessons to be learned from here people Now of course a lot of questions remain will the Kardashians magic still work for long Will Taylor have a nose job so she could resemble her grandpa Will I finish this review already Only time can tell more"

"15","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Jul 31 2012"," Evgeny","it was amazing"," In memory of Alan Rickman who showed us what Severus Snape looks like on the Big Screen I made myself a promise not to use any stills from any Harry Potter movies in my reviews for any book of the series but I have to make an exception today January 14 2016 thus the image above Even people who somehow managed to avoid reading the books and seeing the movies can guess that this book is about Harry Potter s second year the School of Wizardry Hogwarts Before he gets there though he had to fight the depression from loneliness as his adopted family does not care about him much and his Hogwarts friends seemingly forgotten about him Fortunately a magical creature called Dobby shows up and instantly makes Harry s life full of excitement he is convinced Harry s life is forfeit if the latter goes to Hogwarts so Dobby makes everything in his power to stop Harry from doing this Injures and maiming are fair game as long as Harry remains alive To add to the fun it seems Harry s life as well as that of his friends might really be in danger Dobby hinted at Like the first one this book can still fully qualify as a children book however it is darker and it does have some very gloomy and depressing moments children grew up and matured a little and so is the tale We get to meet characters familiar from the first book and see their development as well as new interesting ones Speaking about new people Gilderoy Lockhart is so full of himself he is excellent His whole Valentine celebration made me laugh out loud I think this is the first time we get to meet Lucius Malfoy in person - he is another interesting guy the last scene with him is excellent I would like to talk about Harry Potter a little I saw lots of people say he is not the main hero of the series he is just a guy who always gets either lucky or have a helpful friend handy in tight spots I saw Hermione named the main hero - she is the brainpower behind Harry s successes most of the time I saw Neville named the main hero - he has the greatest and most unexpected development of all characters I would respectfully disagree Harry Potter is the main hero albeit a reluctant one compare him to Lockhart to see why For the proof of this look no further than the final confrontation in this novel This was my reread of the book I knew exactly what to expect and I was sure I would rate it with 4 stars until I found myself awoke well in the early morning hours finishing this reread despite the fact that I had to wake up early Any book which can do it to me deserves 5 stars I do not have anything else to add to what I already said each installment of the series was analyzed and reviewed countless number of times by better qualified people I will stop right here more"

"20","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Jun 03 2011"," Lora","really liked it"," It is our choices Harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities - Albus DumbledoreSuch a wise wizard You know how sometimes when you read the first in a series and it turns out so much better than you originally anticipated it makes you a little apprehensive when starting the sequel Well I felt that way before starting this but I can definitely say that Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is another fabulous installment in the rightfully beloved Harry Potter series And while I will admit to not loving it quite as much as its predecessor I still enjoyed it a great deal I think the reason for my not liking it as much can be mostly credited to the introduction of a new character Professor Lockhart Lockhart is an annoyingly pretentious wizard who is completely full of himself and the majority of his teachings were based on his own life and his supposed brushes with death that he escaped only because of his heroism and great knowledge of the magic arts view spoiler Riiiiiiiiight hide spoiler In a summary I didn t find the story involving Lockhart quite as interesting as Harry s realization of his true abilities and the escapades of his first year at Hogwarts But HP II undoubtedly still has plenty of hilarious moments and magical wonders - not to mention the lovely cast of characters - to more than compensate for this particular installment s slightly lacking plot Hence the five stars view spoiler Very clever Ms Rowling very clever indeed hide spoiler FAVORITE QUOTE I ve heard you hate those Muggles you live with said Ernie swiftly It s not possible to live with the Dursleys and not hate them said Harry I d like to see you try it Next up is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and I m very much looking forward to it My reviews of other titles in this series Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone more"

"24","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Sep 03 2016"," maggie","really liked it"," It is our choices Harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets stars off where Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone left off Harry goes back to his old home for summer and spends time with his ugly family The Dursleys They are no different then they were before but in fact are even more rude As Harry thinks about going back to Hogwarts a new and ugly creature appears in Harry s bedroom as Harry returns upstairs His name is Dobby and he is known as a house-elf one that is treated badly But Dobby didn t come to chat with Harry he came to warn him Warn him about Hogwarts and save him telling him he must not return to Hogwarts He says this because he is trying to warn Harry and tell him that he can put the whole school in danger including his friends and himself But because Harry does not listen and is actually able to go back to Hogwarts thanks to his best friend Ron a lot of things happen this second year and some aren t the best Some include agony being made and being taken back in time a new professor named Gilderon Lockheart a spirit ghost who died in Hogwarts and now haunts the girls bathroom named Moaning Myrtle and even events having to do with Ron Weasley s younger sister Ginny These aren t the only events happening and the only ones making Hogwarts suffer They actually have nothing to do with it There is something or maybe someone who is leading Hogwarts to danger and putting everyone at risk This person or thing is turning students into stone writing on the walls and killing a professor s cat As rumors spread nobody knows who this might be It might be Draco Malfoy since he is known as an evil child wizard in Slytherin or maybe Hagrid since he has been in Hogwarts for a very long time including his studying years there Or any other professor including Snape Dumbledore McGonagall or even Lockhart But if it isn t any of those then it might just be Harry himself I really don t know what to say Words aren t possible because this book was just so wonderful and so fun There were even more magical journeys and I was so glad everyone has changes and J K Rowling decided to changer everyone s character Well almost Where do I start Harry is still the cute cinnamon roll and I love his precious and cute character I hate how he had to suffer even more with the Dursley s and had to even go back as the second year ended I hope he escapes one day for good and never returns because I am so tired of him being treated like shit and like he really does not exist His family is the only family he really has yet they treat him like they wish he was dead and didn t survive The Chamber of Secrets Sure that s what they wish but they should show a little more empathy with him and treat him a little better maybe feed him more food and give him better clothes let him go out with his owl and have some freedom let him write back to his friends when they know he is miserable with them and just be the young Harry Potter he was made to be Other than that he is growing and growing into a much better wizard and is slowly learning even more spells which he ended up using some to defend his friend and fight Draco with Ron oh Ron he is so cute and precious but so dumb in such cute ways He still can t figure out the right magic spells and how to use them making the rest of the crowd laugh at him because of his silly actions He s so funny and when he s worried his face reactions are so cute but so heartbreaking at times because he is just so adorable Draco didn t mock him like he did in the previous book and I was glad for that but he still received laughter from others because of the message he got from his mother the way he tried learning transfiguration and for needing his mother to defend him He isn t learning quick like Harry but I know the time will come and he will become a good wizard and be able to change things into the right objects be able to drive a flying car correctly and defend his friend like he defended him when he needed the saving Hermione was probably my favorite She has changed so much and isn t a bossy high-top nerd anymore She s always at the top able to answer questions before anyone and earning Gryffindor points and that is the reason I loved her a lot more What would Gryffindor Harry and Ron do without Hermione Like my friends have said probably dead or lost because they can t figure out what to do or how things work She actually breaks rules in this book to help Harry and Ron and is also helping them with the secrets they are trying to discover She still supports Harry with his Quidditch matches and is there for them when they need help even when she wasn t supposed to You might be wondering what the 4 stars mean Well like others Ginny was my least favorite character I wish she didn t get in the way and wasn t the reason for the secrets but she was also really dumb She acted dumb in front of Harry and tried stepping up for him only embarrassing herself She was embarrassed by her mom because she was accepted into Gryffindor but she was still dumb She didn t have to listen to Riddle and could ve made the choice of leaving everything out Of course the book would be different and maybe quite boring if it wasn t for her but I still didn t like her character majority of the time I hear she s one of the least favorite characters and I can see why She s pretty annoying and is always blushing when she sees Harry I m guessing she likes him Dobby was not my favorite either only because he tried telling Harry what to do but at the end sure I liked him and was glad he was free because Malfoy was not a good master for him He kicked and hit him for no reasons so I m sure that the reason for his actions when Harry told him to sit The friendship has definetely grown and Hermione Ron and Harry are just best friends They worry about each and everything about them together is just so cute I will admit that I liked this one a little less than the first one but just a little bit I don t use half stars or anything anymore so don t be thinking the first one was better and this one had its flaws because it really didn t disappoint me I just hated some characters and that happens in all novels and Draco is still one of them He s an asshole fight me Like him or not I feel like I will always hate him I feel like he will grow out to be just like this father and become an evil wizard like all Slytherins do I know his appearance won t change and his personality won t either He treats Harry like shit as well because of who he is and sometimes he thinks he s cool because of his father But his father is nothing but a lousy and loud man that tries to show off because of his son and because of what he can afford There was nothing new about him and I hate him for almost everything Well everything actually Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets did not disappoint and left me upset but it had different flaws than the first one Bad ones but I m sure they ll be fixed sometimes I just didn t like Dobby at the beginning but like I said I was glad he was free at the end and defended Harry from Lucius Malfoy I know every story has its own improvement and all analyze but this one might be my least favorite It s like I see it coming Overall I can t wait to see where the next journey takes off and how Harry will escape the Dursley s again more"
"25","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Mar 28 2014"," Bookdragon Sean","really liked it"," This is the worst book in the Harry Potter series The fact that I m still giving it four stars sort of says something about my opinion for the rest of the series It s a wonderful world The magic is alive and the storytelling is extraordinary but here are three reasons why this could never be five stars in my estimation like the rest 1 Gilderoy Lockhart The man is ridiculous to the point of revolting I don t need to say anything else 2 The flying car bits were just stupid More people would have seen it 3 Nobody in the school gets Ron a new wand and they let him run around the school casting dangerous spells The first one is a genuine reason and the last two mere petty grievances There was also something a little off about this book The writing wasn t quite at the same level From here though it only got better more"

"28","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Jan 31 2008"," Chris","liked it"," Since pretty much everyone I know has read these books I figure reviewing them is pretty pointless But with the new book coming out in a couple of weeks I have to go through them beginning to end To make the reviews more entertaining I will be doing them in a variety of unexpected formats For this review I will be writing as someone who s just getting into Freudian theory From the very beginning the true nature of this story is quite obvious - The Chamber of Secrets There is only one chamber of secrets that is of any human concern and it is no coincidence that the book of such a title was written by a woman By sending her young immature male character Harry whose name along with Tom and Dick just happens to be one of the universal male names into the mysterious Chamber Rowling is exploring her memories of early childhood sexuality The Chamber is filled not only with mystery but danger and legend - its very existence is debated which no doubt refers to the elusive female orgasm Ms Rowling whose sexual impulses have no doubt been unfulfilled over the years is attempting to fulfill them by way of her own fiction She has created a perfect sexual explorer in Harry Potter - a young innocent and noble young man whose powers have not yet matured Obviously a male that Rowling would feel comfortable with This is especially interesting given the actual resident of the Chamber of Secrets - a huge deadly serpent And there s only one thing that a huge terrible serpent can represent Rowling s sexual past is the fertile ground in which this book was grown It is her cathartic attempt to win over the guilty feelings that she s repressed from her former sexual life the one she regrets more than anything else by manufacturing a hero That hero in Harry Potter represents the type of man for whom she would open her chamber - pure of heart and noble of intention and most importantly under her control The vanquishing of the serpent-symbol is her victory leaving her free to explore other aspects of her life including the eventual resolution of the Electra complex that appears to have been built up around Professor Dumbledore more"

"51","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Aug 20 2016"," Luke Taylor","it was amazing"," So what is Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets Why perhaps one of the greatest sequels ever written Ha Then why is it the lowest rated of the 7 Why do so many consider it to be their least favorite I don t know I thought it was flipping amazing Why Because Jo Rowling so very English and erudite with her topsy turvy hilarious and creepy narrative her human characters and her timeless topics Jo who knows the human heart like Hermione knows the works of Gilderoy Lockhart hides the motives of every character till the perfect moment of revelation Even those that should be above suspicion are not with the taint of pride and ambition and even the most beloved characters breathe with the fragility of humanity as the story relentlessly runs along through the darkened halls of Hogwarts Beware second-year students the desire to be great is a double-edged sword beset with rubies I first became a fan of Jo with Cuckoo s Calling and it occurred to me breathlessly reading through Chamber of Secrets that the Riddle was solved Finally Why is Jo Rowling so good It s simple She s a mystery writer Harry Potter soars above Muggle mystery books because of its special additives Magic yes and undeniably malleable lenient fantasy elements that Jo masterfully weaves and waves her wand over to manipulate and beef up the story as she sees fit but truly how many mysteries have we read collectively where we set them down and forget who the detective was or the suspect or whatever Why is that Because of Jo s reverse engineering no doubt an ancient Slytherin technique where the character comes first No matter what and no matter which character The books are entirely character driven and because we love The Boy Who Lived and He Who Shall Not Be Named and The Weasleys and Rubeus Hagrid and Ginny the cutest human being on planet earth and on and on and on we find ourselves shoulder to shoulder with our would-be sleuths and puzzle solvers and their we must we must attitude Chamber of Secrets was an outstanding mystery chock-full of red herrings an incredible combative climax and too many laugh-out-loud lines to count Dear Diary I have a new favorite book Oh really what is it Throws diary out the window and runs away screaming And shivers at the mere mention of Azkaban I read Chamber of Secrets with far too much excitement and anticipation because knowing I was going into Harry Potter The Prisoner of Azkaban following Chamber of Secrets was the book I was waiting for the most and for that I blame Gary Oldman I am a Sirius fan of Gary Oldman That said I had no idea that Chamber of Secrets would be so outstanding and leave me thinking the incredible Philosopher s Stone was a perfectly-pitched welcome handshake compared to the books to come For those who like to feel up a book for flaws I have none and I see none I see the sheer verve of adventure and the scintillating luster of mystery gleaming hungry-eyed and ready for more You see as Philosopher s Stone was about love Chamber of Secrets was about fearlessness Fearlessness to speak the truth in the face of a lie fearlessness to stand up for what s inside your heart Fearlessness to take a leap of faith and follow the path of destiny Also I am very interested in how the issues gain maturity as Harry and the other characters age Obviously there are deaths to come but in the case of Chamber of Secrets versus Philosopher s Stone I could feel that sense of maturity creeping in just a bit and am so very excited for the continuation of the series I ll have to go buy some more chocolate frogs now as everything in the Wizarding World becomes increasingly dangerous and unhinged and wild and wondrously unforgettable Recommended for everyone And 50 points for Hermione for being epic even whilst being petrified more"

"82","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Oct 01 2015"," Mikee Andrea ReadWithMikee","really liked it"," This book was slightly more different from the movie as opposed to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone and its film adaptation but I still loved reading about the infamous Chamber of Secrets nonetheless I loved the concept of the Tom Riddle and the diary I was and still am so amazed by the magic in this world After reading the second book I sort of developed a kind of fondness or some unusual respect for Voldemort as a character Of course everything he has done was unforgivable but I can t help but feel pity of him In his youth he really was a bright wizard who just had a troubled past that rippled and created the monster that he would later become I always wondered what spurred his hatred for muggle-borns and this book really clarified that question for me And now rather than seeing Voldemort as this all-powerful evil wizard I just view him more as a tragic character who had such a potential to truly be the greatest wizard in the world that he so wished to be but because of his past and his choices it twisted him and transformed him into the very epitome of evil starting at such a young age I loved this book so much more than the first I can already tell that these books are starting to take a more darker mood compared to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone Reading this series really has me reminiscing my childhood P more"

"87","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Aug 08 2007"," Swaps55","liked it"," While the story fits neatly together and again her imagination is fantastic the flat characters that play to extreme stereotypes take a lot of the enjoymeny out of this story There is no excuse for Gilderoy Lockhart Granted his fame obsession and ludicrous self-absorption make for some amusing Rowling-esque moments that make the series good such as a dozen Lockharts running for cover in the photo frames with rollers in their hair but at the expense of the reader s patience This degree of narcissism even if plausible in the real world stretches my suspension of disbelief too far Like every page with Malfoy on it I d rather flip past them than read them The greatest problem I have with this series is the two dimensional villains or irritating Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers Good villains should draw out some sort of sympathy in the reader or reveal at some point their humanity At the very least you should be able to understand why they are the way they are and that back story allows you to look at them from a different perspective This moment never happens for Lockhart and incidentally it never happens for Malfoy Rowling allowed the perfect opportunity to make Malfoy a good three dimensional villain when Harry and Ron used the Polyjuice potion For the first time we had Malfoy out of the public eye and in private where we could see the real him and not the front everyone else sees Here was the chance to see his humanity that he s such a prick because he s afraid of disappointing his father that he worries about his grades that there s a girl he likes and he s secretly worried she doesn t like him back anything that humanizes him and draws out some sympathy because thus far he s gotten nothing more than eye rolls out of me But we didn t get that moment Rowling wrote him no differently than she does when he is on parade in front of everyone which was really a shame So overall the characters get tiring but the writing style and imagination are extremely enjoyable more"

"96","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Jul 13 2016"," Markus","liked it"," I ve heard this is the weakest Harry Potter book and after having read the first three I think I agree Although I feel the first three have been more or less equal in quality I was annoyed by the new characters Gilderoy Lockhart Dobby and Colin Creevey and I absolutely hate the quidditch scenes and find them excruciatingly boring something I ve complained about to most of the people who tried to convince me to read this Fortunately there are two saving graces One is that the book and the series as a whole is pretty damn exciting and it s hard to put it down for any reason The second is the character of Tom Riddle and all the scenes involving him Since I am reading all the books in direct sequence the events and characters of each book blend together pretty fast so I will probably do a more detailed series review at the end For now all there is to say is that I am actually enjoying Harry Potter Who would ever have thought PS I love all the Weasleys more"

"127","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Feb 03 2018"," John King","it was amazing"," In this review I want to put more weight on the cons over the pros for this book even though I rate the book 5 stars Overall I believe this is a great set up book in the sense that many things may not entirely make sense in this book but it sets up the tone and future plot points for all future books To some extent one may say this book came a bit too soon In this book the main characters delve into the dark side of the magical world but ultimately this world is still too complex for a single book to fully encompass However again this book is a necessary part of the series in order to understand the future books Moreover Chamber of Secrets opens doors to information that will become critical as the story unfolds One example may be the portrayal of Voldermort or the Dark Lord s past and how he desires to destroy Harry Perhaps the finale of this book with Voldermort and Tom Riddle redeems the book It is unfortunate that more time is not devoted to their stories but they are reserved adequately for the future series Finally as with all the Potter books there are certain new and somewhat of small matters that add to the inventive imagination of J K Rowling These elements include the incidents with the flying cars and the falling pudding The house elf Dobby is pretty awesome too more"

"129","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Mar 29 2017"," Daniel Clausen","it was amazing"," So there they were staring me in the face at work a full collection of the Harry Potter books A student had donated them One of my coworkers was also a fan So there they were at work on the book shelf unread a challenge of the fun slightly-retro popular culture kind I show off my growing knowledge of the book to my self-described Harry Potter-loving coworker A muggle is a person who doesn t use magic I smile I pretend I care I think my coworker cares but actually it occurs to me at this moment that she might be faking it as well This leads to an interesting question How many Harry Potter fans have been faking it all this time I care more now that I ve entered the Great Depression I need to escape the world of The Grapes of Wrath at least for a little bit The world of 1930s itinerant farmers from Oklahoma is weighing me down It s a bitter hardscrabble world of the poor and soon to be destitute If Tom Joad isn t doing so well finding work in California maybe Harry and his friends are doing better in Hogwarts Do they have plenty of food to eat Check Do they own shoes Check No threats of getting beat to death with a shovel Check What is a simple rivalry with Malfoy compared to a rivalry with hunger Oh and there is flying car an owl and a bunch of new words to learn so I don t have to feel like a muggle Harry Potter is the kind of book you read if you want to get away from bitter grapes Harry Pa told me I had to sell my wand Said if I didn t get no 2 dollars for it the yougins gonna go hungry For all the magic elements Hogwarts is a school It feels safe It feels like the people there are members of a community It feels like the world has coherence Malfoy the Dursleys these are just background shades of black that help the reader appreciate the beauty and wonder of Hogwarts Hog Warts Hogwarts A mashup of two ugly things But there is nothing ugly about Hogwarts It might as well be Neverland for all the beauty and color it has Sure the writer might convince us it is drab and foreboding Sure the California of Steinbeck might look on the surface like a paradise But in Hogwarts no one has to worry about work Hermoine Last night I done boiled down my books and et dem I got to eit dem Or I gots to eat dirt How good is this book for curing a bout of the Great Depressions Well I forgot almost the entire plot of the Grapes of Wrath while trying to understand the rules of Quiddich Girlfriend just broke up with you Try understanding the rules of Quiddich and then see if you even remember her name Got angry with your boss about something Try calling your best friend and explaining to him or her what is going on in a game of Quiddich I wonder if I can do this again I wonder if I can read one book to escape another Not necessarily Harry Potter but something like Harry Potter Basically the fun blonde of books to help me even out the highs and lows of my brainy manic-depressive brunette of books The last paragraph seems unnecessarily crude yet I can t get myself to delete it It occurs to me now that Dobby and the house elves are the closest thing the book has to Okies in the Grapes of Wrath Someday mark my word there will be a book about the starving and hungry house elves from Harry Potter Magical Broths of Wrath more"

"141","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Dec 11 2016"," Trish","it was amazing"," The second part in the Harry Potter series is about Harry in his second year at Hogwarts and some mysterious and rather dark events there that are quite political by nature The review about the actual story will be the one for the printed edition this one shall focus on the audio version itself As with the first I compared it to the American version narrated by Mr Jim Dale And as with the first I switched the American version off after a short amount of time already There simply is nobody I can imagine doing a better job of giving each and every one of Rowling s characters life and their very own personality than Stephen Fry He s a master when it comes to intonations accents and translating the magic from the pages into the recording so as to transport the reader into the Forbidden Forest or the Gryffindor or in this case even the Slytherin common room I especially like his version of Hagrid which always makes me picture Robbie Coltrane himself Honestly it s more like a full-cast dramatisation than a book narrated by just one person more"

"156","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Jan 17 2016"," Becky","really liked it"," I always have to wonder just what Lucius plan was It s said in later books I believe that he didn t know what he had did he think it was just a cursed object Or did he really think that the memory could have the power to do what he planned not knowing that there was a real tether It just seems rather short-sighted on Lucius part Anyway this is actually my least favorite of the series I am far far in the minority on this but I just find Dobby to be a bit tiresome I know why people love him but each time I read this book I like him a bit less I did love Snape in this book though he has a pretty small role in this one His micro-expressions though love them When he finds out a student was taken into the Chamber and he grips the back of the chair - that can be interpreted in so many ways That is why I love Snape s character so much - he s not friendly not likable not charming but throughout the whole series his smallest moves and gestures can be seen to be whatever the viewer projects on them He s like a blank slate If you think he s evil you will see his actions that way I love that he s willing to walk that line Also this is the book that made me love Ron His reaction when Hermione is attacked and his slide down the wall when he hears about Ginny are just perfect His reaction when Hermione recovers is so adorable and great It s one of my favorite moments in the book and it s literally like one sentence long I love Ron Hermione together Harry and Hermione No way Anyway I m not reading these in my usual no-interruptions straight through method and it feels a bit weird but whatever I m going with it On with the next more"
"157","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Jul 26 2007"," J G Keely","did not like it"," In her second outing Rowling builds up her confidence and relationship with her publisher enough to begin her signature page number crawl Unfortunately for this book her chaotic plotting means that the further length just becomes more scattered moments Despite some interesting twists and concepts this is the weakest entry in the series It betrays a utilitarian sense of plot and worldbuilding in that it expands the story little Of course Rowling never really gets the process of streamlining or simplification into her literary arsenal but later books in the series come to use her meandering style more to her benefit The movie s probably your better bet My Fantasy Book Suggestions more"

"174","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Dec 28 2016"," Dana Al-Basha","it was amazing"," I started rereading the second book and I must admit Dobby is getting on my nerves We have a saying in Arabic which means that too much of anything is as bad as less which means that too much love or whatever Dobby is doing is as bad as hate I don t like anyone interfering with my life The Dursleys as always are so horrible I always think it s weird not to like a kid even if the kid is not yours or to your liking especially that Harry isn t a bad kid in general Weird bunch the Dursleys I wish Goodreads would separate the illustrated copies from the original work I no longer can find my old reviews anyway It would be easier to find and review Ron made me laugh like crazy throughout the book and film Of all the trees we could ve hit we had to get one that hits back My favorite scenes must be the car stealing both times the dual and the mandraks class Hilarious I love when Moaning Myrtle goes crazy with laughter after Hermione takes the Polyjuice potion If I disliked Gilderoy Lockhart in the movie I detested him in the book What an arrogant insufferable narcissistic man But Hermione s fascination with him was hilarious I can t wait for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Illustrated Edition in October 3 2017 It s getting closer and I m getting more excited more"

"197","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Oct 16 2016"," Donna","it was amazing"," Five stars for both a story that concludes with a most satisfying ending and the amazing illustrations that once again have brought the characters and their adventures to life I m very glad I waited to read this series in this form even though I must wait for the next book to be released each year and even though it takes much longer to read each book this way with all the extra time spent staring at the wonderful artwork It is sometimes splashed across entire pages or integrated with the text but never intrusive The illustrations only enhance the story and are a treat to view I refused to peek ahead so I would be surprised And I surely was surprised starting with the table of contents which was crawling with life-like spiders I m a bit phobic of spiders you see and there were many of them in this book I m sure I ll see them in my dreams or should I say my nightmares But there were many more illustrations to savor that were atmospheric or dramatic or captured the essence of each character at any particular moment in time One of my favorites was a very intuitive sketch of Draco on page 45 that showed not only a hint of malice but a hint of vulnerability that elicited sympathy from me Now that s artistic talent As for the story I enjoyed accompanying Harry as he began his second year at Hogwarts where he encountered a challenging mystery threatening people s lives along with the very existence of Hogwarts This second year at school was a trying one for Harry even before he headed off for classes due to the Dursleys determination to make him miserable over vacation Most children wish for a break from school but not Harry since Hogwarts is the closest thing to what he can call a home He made many friends there his first year but also enemies it s clear when he returns And he learned a lot in his first year especially about friendship but during his second year he learned even more though not all of his lessons were learned in the classroom In fact his most important lesson his second year had nothing to do with defense against the Dark Arts or potion mixing Instead it came from Dumbledore himself when he told Harry It is our choices that show what we truly are far more than our abilities Along the way Harry also learned about goodness loyalty courage trust patience and tolerance not to mention disappointment prejudice cowardice and the many forms in which evilness can masquerade I wonder what Harry and his friends will learn in their third year And I wonder what exciting illustrations Jim Kay will come up with to enrich their story I intend to find out same time next year See you then more"

"206","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Aug 05 2017"," MaryJane","it was amazing"," Chamber of Secrets is brilliant This is my least favorite of the series Because basically this book has a lot of pettiness the worlds most irritating character LOCKHART and giant spiders and yet it is so important to the series because it sets everything up so well and indicates just how much JK had planned for her series even this early on So while there are a lot of qualities that I dislike and which sort of distract the reader from all the important things there are still a lot of important things that happen It s really well done because it shows that at this point in Harry s story he is still young and focused on the more trivial things including the petty the irritating and the scary spiders ok I just this is brilliant This isn t my first second third or even fourth time rereading this so I m sorry to say that I can t really write a proper review It becomes difficult to talk about how you feel about a book how a book makes you feel when you have so much history with them So instead I am just going to mention some of the things that I really appreciated THIS time around - I need to acknowledge that every single time I read this book I find Dobby to be incredibly annoying when he is first introduced Obviously by the end I am singing a different song my lil precious baby but I just love that his character is so well done that even though I understand his struggle and the reasons for him acting the way that he does that it doesn t change my first initial reaction to him - I love Collin Creevy - I really appreciated the car in this book more this time than I ever have before - view spoiler I love how we start to see similarities in Harry Voldemort in this book From their back stories to their time at school it is just SO WELL DONE IMO Really sets the stage for a lot of things that are revealed later on in the story hide spoiler - view spoiler I love how Harry mentions that he is so drawn to the diary because this ends up being incredibly relevant in the later books when dealing with the other horcruxes This really shows how well thought out the series was hide spoiler - view spoiler When Tom Riddle explains how he takes control over Ginny by winning her over and gaining her trust is really important in helping to show the power that he had over people especially when he was at his peak hide spoiler - view spoiler I love the tension over believing Harry is the heir of slytherin in this book because it becomes so ironic later on when readers discover everything that is revealed in Deathly Hallows hide spoiler So yeah everything including every single annoying thing is so important to the story even if readers don t realize until later on This is amazing I love it even when I hate it I love it more"

"211","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Mar 20 2010"," Trish","it was amazing"," After I finally read the first book in the Harry Potter series I couldn t hold back for long In the meantime I am such a huge Potterhead fan I know next to all details by heart and cannot get enough extra bits and pieces of information Nevertheless I always enjoy going back to this world - especially the early years full of school subjects and contests So this Christmas it was time to dive deep into nostalgia and go back to visit the classrooms with Harry and the other second-years Unfortunately the second book has long been my least favourite one And you know why Dobby Yeah I realize it s not a very popular thing to say and yes my opinion changed dramatically throughout and especially after the 4th book but in this one I hated him He was soooo annoying and ruined everything It starts in the Muggle world when a battered little house elve named Dobby turns up at No 4 Privet Drive where Harry still has to spend his summer holidays much to his dismay Dobby soon manages to make Harry s living situation with the Dursleys much worse - if you can imagine that being possible But the Weasley boys come to the rescue and we finally get to meet the rest of their family or nearly all of it as well as the Burrow one of the coziest houses I could imagine Harry being there means he and through him the reader gets to see a 100 magical household complete with an introduction to the Floo Network And that together with Dobby s constant sabotage as well as the new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher Lockheart means we also get to see what happens when magic doesn t work or at least not the way we the witch wizard intended it to But much more than that the reader also gets to see a slightly more political side of the magical world It s not just about school bullying or child abuse anymore we also see Draco s father having and constantly abusing his slave Dobby And then there is the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets itself of course with all the awfulness about Mudbloods and the danger of dying students Thus overall the story is much darker than the first one Keep in mind what made it into the movie and how the story still worked there despite all the intricate details having been left out This was already clearly discernible during the first book but became even more pronounced in this one The movies are very good but the books even the thinner first three give you so much more Moreover we get more details about the different aspects of magic and magic-users and the writing style itself is simply more as well I already mentioned in my review of the first book that this will continue throughout the series because Rowling deliberately used it as her signature style as the protagonists get older so the writing itself feels more mature because the story gets more complex dangerous It s a wonderful way especially for young readers who age with the books So although this isn t my favourite book in the series I still loved it and everything it showed me good and bad and am especially happy when letting my fingers roam this special edition the feeling of the linen binding alone is wonderful more"

"213","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Mar 30 2008"," Brad","it was ok"," This really is the worst book of the Harry Potter bunch and its lack of quality isn t helped by its position in the series For all its faults Philosopher s Stone is a strong first novel and does a great job of sucking its readers in - even the grown up ones - and Prisoner of Azkaban for its balanced mix of suspense character development and the first real glimpse of the world beyond Hogwarts and Privet Dr makes it for me the best of the entire series So Chamber of Secret s number two position is a bad place to be in the Harry Potter world What it boils down to is that Chamber of Secrets is kinda dumb This is the third time I ve read the book and the first time I ve read it out loud to my kids and it just doesn t work well There s too much idiocy really The flying car is dumb Hermione turning into a half-cat is dumb Gilderoy Lockhart is dumb though played extremely well by Kenneth Branagh in the movie Aragog the big blind spider is dumb And even Dobby is dumb long before he becomes interesting For all these reasons the book feels outside the Potter universe Almost everything in the other book makes sense to me but this one is bizarre What makes it worth reading despite its dumbness are the bits and pieces that hint at the world we ll see in the future the introduction of Dobby and the house elves the first taste of Tom Riddle the beginning of the long road of love for Ginny and Harry the naming of Azkaban as a prison that evokes terror and the introduction of the surprisingly important Moaning Myrtle set us up for what s to come Yes it s a crummy book but it s not horrible And kids love it so that s gotta be worth more than one star but only just more"

"222","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Dec 16 2012"," Erin Proud Book Hoarder","really liked it"," It is our choices Harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities It s not as easy to review such a well-loved and received series The base story is already familiar to me since I ve seen the movies While the first followed the movie plot line closely I noticed little scenes and extras in this book that didn t make their transfer to film As before Harry starts in the house of horrors aka the Dursley residence where they treat the kid so poorly I m surprised he doesn t lose it and become an evil wizard himself I can totally understand his desire to go to Hogwarts and escape that household as morbidly amusing as it is and it DOES make a good opening to these novels Hogwarts was already fleshed out fully in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone but the charm and magic of the series came further alive in this second installment It seems that Rowland has become more comfortable with writing itself something that s hard for me to put a finger on exactly but it s felt all the same This book just read better the previous mild cheese coating dusted away leaving a fun joy behind It s not all happiness and games however what good story would be There s a darkness lurking around the corner and a mystery to solve First the professor Gilderoy Lockheart The new Dark Arts teacher is introduced to this series bringing numerous hilarious scenes that worked perfectly What fun it is to follow the three kids through their classes - the clueless and boastful professor is a contrast to the experiences in the classroom of the slithering Snape who seems to have it against the kids Hogwarts itself has such a strong presence in the novels - from the teachers the classes the studied subjects Dumbledore Hagrid and his cottage of tea and bizarre animals that creepy Forbidden Forest with giant critters that nightmares are made of and now let s throw in secrets passages and riddles and secret diaries If that doesn t make a workable magical concoction then I don t know what does Since I d experienced the story celluloid style it held little surprise I m sure if I were naive going in I d have been surprised at the twist with the riddle for Tom Riddle the discovery of the creature waiting in the bowels of the school and the small twists that came about but it was still a joy to experience in written form even if I knew the waiting answers Pacing is kept up strong - you d think it may be dull to spend so much time in a classroom but not at all for it unfolds naturally applying in various ways to not only the main story of the Chamber but to small details of the characters lives that will continue enriching the series Harry is a wonderful protagonist - he s reasonable and decent but still a typical type of wizard kid willing to break small rules all for a spot of fun or dire circumstances Ron is humorous without meaning to be that unfortunate type who has bad luck and circumstance but shines with their general personality and of course Hermione is a great confidante and friend you like to have around especially when you aren t sure of the right curse to muster or potion to mix Definitely recommended hard to put down I enjoyed this one more than the first Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone wasn t bad but something felt awkward to me kind of like the beginning of one those odd school moments where teachers are trying to get kids to learn lame square dancing and then sectioning the kids into gender to dance together I m happy to say that awkwardness isn t present in Chamber of Secrets and the heart of the series has started beating harder - it s not possible for me not to continue this series now Let the magic continue more"

"249","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Nov 22 2008"," Jason Koivu","liked it"," Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the number two of the entire Potter series in more ways than one It s the turd of the lot It s not terrible but compared to the rest of the series Chamber has all the originality of a carbon copy of its predecessor written to mirror and capitalize on the success of the first book Yes Harry and schoolmates have moved on to their second year and there are occurrences that will later come into play in the bigger picture of the story but in hindsight these seem like mere happenstance that had to be cajoled into the plot once Rowling realized she had a hit on her hands that demanded sequels and a big finish Perhaps I m wrong Maybe this was all part of her grand scheme from word-one It just doesn t feel like it though And the movie Don t get me started on the movie It s the only one we don t own My wife refuses to buy it and has forbade me to gift it to her I blame Kenneth Branagh more"

"268","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Mar 30 2016"," Sarah","it was amazing"," I absolutely adore these illustrated editions of the Harry Potter series the first one was stunning and the Chamber of Secrets is just as beautiful so I can t wait to have the entire series on sitting on my shelves I m not going to talk about the story in this review I ve already done that HERE so instead I ll focus on the quality of the book and the artwork Just like the Philosopher s Stone illustrated edition this is a beautiful book in every way possible I m sure everyone who is looking at this already owns the previous one and has a good idea what to expect but just in case you re considering buying both illustrated versions I ll give you the highlights These books are large hardbacks with good quality glossy pages full of wonderful illustrations to go along with the familiar text of the story I love the way the illustrations vary from tiny little images through to whole double page spreads because you just never know what you ll find when you turn over the page These books are an experience and they beg to be read out loud with children or to have someone sit for hours just studying the pictures Jim Kay has really done such a fabulous job of bringing the stories to life in a different way it would have been so easy to base these images on the movies that we re all so familiar with but he s created his own version of the world and the characters that are similar enough to be easily recognised but still completely his own versions I honestly could have included hundreds of pictures with this review but I ve tried to narrow it down to just a few of my favourites An illustrated version of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets One that matches the absolutely STUNNING copy of Philosopher s Stone I NEED this book in my life more"
"269","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Jun 20 2014"," Ryan Buckby","it was amazing"," I have lost count on how many times i have re-visited this series and every time i come back i feel like i m going home because these characters and this world will always have a special place in my heart and i owe it all to J K Rowling I remember when i was little and i had to sneak into my older brothers room because he had the books and i didn t at the time i would take them and read them and my childhood was magical like many other people s childhood all thanks to this series It is our choices Harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities Plot This book picks up with Harry once again spending the summer with his family at number 4 privet drive Waiting for the summer to end so he can finally return to Hogwarts and be with his new found friends Ron and Hermione However the journey to getting there isn t the best because Dobby the house elf thinking he s doing Harry a favour stops him from walking through the barrier making him and Ron miss the train so they result to flying a car to school The school year starts of bad for Harry and Ron with them almost getting expelled from the school but things at the school start to go from odd to strange where the teachers and students life s are put in danger when the Chamber of Secrets is re-opened after 50 years Even though Chamber of secrets isn t one of my favourites in the series i was listening to this for the first time via audiobook and say since growing older and reading it a few more times i can understand appreciate the story more since i ve matured Characters Harry Potter Harry is put to his second ultimate test in the second book after a shocking start to the school year harry finds himself dealing with all the crazy laws and accusations that have come with the chamber of secrets being opened After its revealed that he can talk to snakes the whole school and some teachers become skeptical about him and this begins his year of trying to prove everyone in the school wrong I m glad Harry has Ron and Hermione who believed him from the beginning because if they didn t i feel like Harry would be on his own entirely As the school year progresses and some of the muggle born students mrs norris and nearly headless nick are petrified it all comes down to harry to stop it from happening to any more people were harry meets voldemort for the second time and naturally defeats him Ron Weasley Ron is one of Harry s best friends throughout the entire series and he provides the comedic relief and trys to see things as rational as he can I feel like Ron is very underestimated out of the three and its because he is shunned between a famous boy and a clever witch but i think Ron has an edge on both of the two since he is from a family who grew up in this wizard world so i think it gives him more information that the other two don t know Ron is also dealing with being put on a scale so high because of who his brothers are and how well they ve all done in school so i feel ron knows it and has that to deal with Hermione Granger One of my favourite characters in this series because she is truly the brightest witch of her age and i love how she doesn t care what anybody things about her in the way she is so smart and how she looks even though she does get teased by Malfoy and the rest of slytherin because of this Hermione is the one who fights for whats right and brings a lot of political issues to the surface that this wizarding world seems to be having and yes this world has it s troubles that effect not only Hermione but every muggle born student house elf etc She does grow from the first book but don t get me wrong she doesn t change from being that geeky girl who loves to learn which i love about this character When in doubt go to the library Hearing voices no one else can hear isn t a good sign even in the wizarding world This is one series that i will always continue to come back to because it s what got me into reading and got me started for my love of books and i will always be thankful for Jo for writing this magical series I honestly can t thank her enough because this series is and always will be important to me more"

"279","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," May 02 2014"," Martyn Stanley","really liked it"," Hmmm Where to start with this one I read the whole book aloud to my 9 year old daughter Emily I read her the first book in the series last year and she loved it She COULD read it herself however I think she likes my narration I put a lot effort into my narrator s voice and accents and tones for the characters -You should hear my Dumbledore Dobby and Hagrid With Harry Potter there IS a temptation to be biased I watched the films first and loved them all my bookie friends love Harry Potter and I really enjoyed the films and the books I ve read so far The thing is though there s almost an expectation for these books to be perfect They aren t I ve got things wrong in my books The print editions will need updating eventually and I occasionally revise and update the Kindle editions The Last Dragon Slayer is free to download at the moment if you re interested I don t think trad-pub authors have this luxury However Rowling had an even greater luxury She had the capacity to change some quite major things in the transition to film Broadly speaking I think these changes have improved the stories Yes yes I m sure they could have filmed the potions test at the end of book 1 but really the film version was neater In THIS book I found some elements jarring because in my opinion they were so much poorer than the same scenes in the film One in particular stood out - I ll get to that shortly So the book starts out with Harry at the mercy of the despicable Dursley s again I thought the dynamic of them believing Harry could cast spells on them at any time was quite satisfying They didn t really play this up in the film enough I can imagine why but this was one area where the book was STRONGER than the film It really did lose something when it went to the big screen in this respect The escape from the Dursley s however I thought was weaker here In the film Harry s trunk and stuff were all in his room and that seemed much more realistic than Fred or George climbing and sneaking through the house It made for a more dynamic scene too I thought I did enjoy Harry s longer sojourn to the Weasley s In the film version you got a feeling that he d just nipped there on the way to Hogwarts but in the book you enjoy a much more interesting and detailed look at the Weasley family s life Really the Weasleys are like the wizarding world s version of outdoorsy people I think The people who live at places like Buxton and are members of the climbing club whose houses are full of climbing stuff and more but are truly homely and warm places to be They re bubbly friendly people who like to chat and have an air of optimism and pragmatism that s infectious They have a warm sense of humor It s a pleasure to spend time with the Weasleys I think the film cut Weasley time because of time constraints and because it wasn t critical to the plot It s a pity though if they d made book 2 into a series this could have been dragged out Ron and Harry made a much more exciting and dramatic entrance to Hogwarts this year I think the film-makers toned down the little Ford Anglia a little and I can see why The way it s described in the book would have been very difficult to accurately portray in the film The discussion that happened in Snape s office and them missing the feast was hmmm I don t recall seeing that in the film The ghost s death-day party was noticed absent in the film too I enjoyed that scene it was interesting but I can see why they cut It didn t add much to the story What DID add a lot to the story and was missed in the film was Minor Spoiler Warning Filch turning out to be a squib This doesn t ring a bell I don t think this was explained in the film at all but I think it s important It gives you some empathy for Filch and helps you understand why he s the bitter individual he comes across as I thought the quidditch match with the sabotaged balls played out better in the film too It was okay here but I really thought the film improved it Lockhart s character was more explored in the book I thought I DO think they cast the perfect actor for him Once at the school and attending classes The petrification starts happening The film played very similar to the book here and the whole thing worked Ginny and the diary were as suitably foreshadowed here as in the film but I thought the diary being dumped in a cauldron with other books was more realistic than being slipped into a book Yes maybe Rowling s original vision for the diary was one of those slim pamphlet type things I liked the film diary better Interestingly when Harry and Ron were hiding under the invisibility cloak inside Hagrid s hut and Dumbledore and Hagrid were making announcements to thin air about feeding fang following the spiders and help being available Emily said Wouldn t they be suspicious I have to say I think they would I would be if someone started loudly telling thin air to feed the dog It made for a very amusing scene in the film and Robbie Coltrane played a blinder But realistic I ll let it off because it was so funny but even my daughter picked up on the daft factor I thought the Aragog scene played out better in the film but I thought the hiding of Tom Riddle s identity was more effective in the book The finale was enjoyable and satisfying in both I liked the more drawn out film battle with the Basilisk better but it might have dragged if Rowling had spent so long on it in the book The most jarring thing for me about the book relates to the diary and the last scene Again this might be down to Rowling changing her vision of the diary from being a slim thin pamphlet style thing to a good sized pocket book for the film However it really grated in the book In book Lucious Malfoy is accused of planting the diary in Dumbledore s office with Harry and Dumbledore present That didn t sit right to me THEN Harry puts the diary in a sock and throws the SOCK at Lucius I had a hard time picturing that It didn t really make sense Then Malfoy gives Dobby the sock He s NOT that stupid I really don t think he d do that He d see the sock and realise the ruse So much cleverer in the film Harry runs out AFTER Lucius Malfoy after hiding his SOCK in the book Then he passes the diary to Mr Malfoy saying I believe this is yours sir and explaining how he saw him plant it Malfoy of course can t be bothered to open it or carry it so he thrusts it at Dobby Who takes it opens it and finds the sock SO much MORE realistic It was genuine triumph of film over book for me It played out so well in the film I feel like knocking a star off the book review for it Yes I enjoyed this book thoroughly I really want to read the next one We don t have it yet so I m reading her Lion Boy instead However the final scene with the sock and diary almost ruined it for me The other changes were fine some good some slightly bad However I really wish Rowling had come up with the final cut which made it into film when she d written the book It was much MUCH better I know it seems harsh this was a great book I know the book came first but this is how I feel Really enjoyed it but I wish the publisher and Rowling had gotten together and worked the final scene from the FILM into the edition of the book I read Final note The absence of the word Horcrux was duly noted here Had Rowling decided how these things worked when she wrote this Had she even got a name for them I wonder I know the series was planned but Interesting

"284","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Jul 03 2015"," Carrie The Butterfly Reader","liked it"," This novel picks up with Harry at home with those dreadful Dursleys I m still wishing I could jump inside this book and beat them within an inch of their life But I m getting off topic it s just a few months after the first novel ended summer vacation On a very important night for Mr Dursley Harry is confined to his room where a mysterious house elf named Dobby Dobby tells Harry that he can t come back to going Hogwarts as something bad would happen Harry refuses as he can t stay here any longer so Dobby does something terrible trying to keep Harry from going Harry is trapped Mr Dursley has locked him in his room and barred his windows but it doesn t stop Harry with the help from the Weasley s he gets out of that horrid place Before heading to Hogwarts they have to stop and gather the supplies for the year in Diagon Alley Here they run into Mr Malfoy whom I wish would die in a fire like yesterday and Lockhart who I also wish would go die in fire It was really cool to see Mr Malfoy and Mr Weasley got into a scuffle which so should ve been in the movie After a whole lot of trouble getting to Hogwarts Harry and Ron get into quite a bit of trouble but luckily they don t get expelled So classes start up and guess who just happens to be their new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Lockhart It s so easy to be annoyed by him like Harry and Ron are Its s not hard to tell he s a fake from a mile away Harry starts hearing a voice that no one else can hear It s also revealed that he can talk to snakes Which is a very Slytherin like trait coming all the way from THE Slytherin Then terrible things start to happen Finch s cat gets petrified with an eerie message left on the wall It s not long after that even students are in danger including Hermione Many believe it s Harry opening the Chamber like this and hurting the students After putting all the pieces together Harry ends up down in the Chamber of Secrets facing off against a huge snake and young Voldemort It all ends well though Harry saves the day as he does each book though this time he also sets Dobby free This one was so much better than the first one I m glad I read it My partner says each book just keeps getting better and I hope he s right I can t wait to find out if he s right I do have one silly nit pick with this book the end where Harry puts the diary into his sock could that work I have small feet and no book even a small one is going to fit in my sock yeah that scene is my favorite from the movie but it just made me laugh so hard when I read it and I know that wasn t the right reaction to Dobby being saved more"

"286","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Dec 11 2016"," Trish","it was amazing"," This is the second book about Harry Potter the second year of Harry being at Hogwarts As with the first volume I m not gonna get into too much detail about the contents it s so well known anyway but it is a slightly darker tale than the first one already and the reader does get a more detailed look into the magical world as well as more complex characters and quite some development Which means that in this wonderful illustrated edition we also get many more wonderful illustrations showing even more fantastically magical places creatures and characters The outside of the slipcase has a giant golden spider on the red linen while the book itself has the Hogwarts greenhouses printed in gold on it As in my previous review I ll let you judge the illustrations for yourselves by showing you some As the story most of the illustrations are darker too For example there are several chapters that have a black background with white text and illustrations of Draco Malfoy or Knockturn Alley And the normal illustrations are often in a darker or even only paler pallette as well Not to mention the huge fold-out piece showing another corner of Diagon Alley it s too big to take a picture of it The illustrated versions are a delight but I must say that the deluxe edition is a very special gem once again Sure it is quite an investment and they are heavy as hell meaning you can only read them at home but both I have were totally worth it and I can t wait for the next to be released more"

"288","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Dec 23 2015"," Christine Spoors","it was amazing"," When I was younger Chamber of Secrets was one of my least favourite books in the series but as I was rereading it for the first time in years I realised that I absolutely love it In this book we see a lot more of the wizarding world and the world building is brilliant throughout it is of course also brilliant to see Harry Ron and Hermione s relationship grow Harry s first trip to the Burrow is so cute it s one of my favourite parts of the whole series It s so interesting reading about an average wizarding home I think Gilderoy Lockhart is an absolutely brilliant character and I love rereading all of his scenes he is so sassy The plot is so clever and the whole story is filled with subtle clues and hints which I love I also love that there are so many references to future books and other parts of the world which we have yet to encounter JK Rowling is absolutely fantastic as we all know and my reread of the series is really reminding me just why I love Harry Potter so much more"
"289","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Jun 22 2009"," Olivia","really liked it"," Harry Ron and Hermione are back at Hogwarts even though Dobby a rather annoying house-elf tried everything in his power to keep Harry from going back Bad things will happen he warned Harry But of course the trio is back at school and then the heir of Slytherin opens the Chamber Of Secrets and within the chamber there is a monster Oh and there are giant spiders Of the series this one and the fifth one are my least favourite and still I love both books so much which says a lot about the series It s still a children s book but already a bit more serious than the first in the series Slowly the books grow with the generation that was reading them Which is probably why the whole Universe means such an awful lot to a whole generation more"

"292","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Nov 10 2010"," Emily","it was amazing"," Chamber of Secrets is sort of the red-headed stepchild the sixth Weasley brother of the series but it gave me my favorite Harry Potter movie casting of all time The first three books are more economical because they have to be and every single event that happens in Chamber of Secrets - from Ron s wand snapping to Harry s appearance in Dumbledore s office - has some bearing on the plot which makes it exciting to watch the carefully laid story unfold I also just straight up love Lockhart It s possible I love him more on every reading more"

"295","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"," Jan 23 2016"," Juanita Story","it was amazing"," Just when you think Harry Potter couldn t get better here comes Chamber of Secrets Rowling does a good job of adding something to story with the mudbloods and purebloods and I like how she had Harry explain quidditch again just in case you missed it again in the first novel There s a lot more to than that but everyone s read or at least seen Harry Potter so this should be an easy choice"
