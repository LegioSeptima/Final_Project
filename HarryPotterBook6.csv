"1","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Jan 20 2014"," C G Drews","it was amazing"," Read Harry Potter they said It ll be fun they said Our childhood was built on Harry Potter they said WELL YOUR CHILDHOODS WERE ALL HORRIBLE OMG WHAT IS THIS BOOK WHAT IS THIS MESS I M IN Excuse me but that large salty lake where my life used to be is my tears Yes yes this means I loved it But SERIOUSLY Nooooot okay At the end there especially I couldn t put the audio down so I was wandering about my house in a blind daze listening instead And because every human and their fluffy poodle has probably sensibly reviewed this book BAH I m just going to make a list of things I loved and things I didn t My Intense And Passionate LOVES Harry Ginny yes I was dubious at first Like I think romance is NOT JKR s strong point plus when she gets to a romantic scene she ends the chapter HHAHAH ADORABLE Not that I minded I just I think she s not good at romance But omg there was that moment after the Quidditch match YUP You know what I m talking about Excuse me my heart just ran around in circles screaming and shipping Hermione I adore her but I gotta admit she was a little bit too stuffy BUT I STILL LOVE HER I love her love for learning I also adore how sensible Ginny is Fred and George s joke shop gives life Also death probs but liiiiife I am utterly in LOVE with the whole concept of Hogwarts I mean I think it s stupid that they have to write with a quill and ink can t they just enchant the quill to write for them and they seem to get an excessive amount of homework BUT It s all so vivid and detailed and it literally feels like Hogwarts is A REAL PLACE I totally get why people wail about their letters going missing Speaking of detail me likey I always felt inside the story Plus the audio book narrated by Jim Dale is GREAT I totally recommend it I think Hermione s voice had a tendency to sound like an insufferable goat but I got used to it Harry s voice was perfection I also particularly liked Harry in this book I JUST LOVE HARRY 3 He s snarky but he s lost some of the angriness from bk 5 He s got snarky quips at the ready but he s also intensely good Like he s just a really GOOD chap who makes bad decisions but really means well ZOMG flails about He was definitely my favourite character in this book ALSO DUMBLEDORE WAS GREAT I love Dumbledore and how he s always polite and kind and smiley view spoiler CAN WE TALK A MINUT EHOW I M NOT OKAY THAT HE S DEAD LIKE WHAT EVEN THE FLYING HECK OF BROOMS NEST TAILS THAT DOESN T MAKE SENSE BUT IT SHOULDN T BECAUSE NOTHING MAKES SENSE Dumbledore no Come baaaaaaaack breaks down into a mess I am also intensely furious that his weakening himself to get the horcrux was useless MAD Okay I AM MAD Character deaths where they failed are the worst there are hide spoiler My Intense and Passionate LOATHES Hhahahha you ready for this Okay so question WHY do they sometimes go places and buy food and sometimes they just magic it Like Mrs Weasely magics onion soup out of nothing for Harry But in the next chapter Harry and Ron are peeling sprouts LIKE WUT This makes no sense to me Why didn t Dumbledore pour the evil potion on the ground instead of drinking it Just wannna know How the FLYING FRIKKIN BROOMSTICKS can anyone possibly convince me Snape is still on the good side Because I don t even care He can go abra kadabra himself to Timbuktu and DIE THERE THANKS There is no repentance after this I don t even care what the reason is in book 7 but Harry you are an idiot to name your kid after Snape I HOPE SNAPE DIES DID I MENTION MY HATE FOR SNAPE YET Oh and another thing I am so angry at Snape arghhhqqwqq Okay Good now I m calm Thank you HAHHAHHAHAHTE SNAPE Yes I truly am calm this time I m good So I also am fairly annoyed about Voldermort s Tom Riddle backstory Because he read like he was straight out of a psychopath text book which I found monstrously unimaginative Attractive calm subtle bully kleptomaniac limited emotional reach charmer smooth blah blah Yes I can just read a book about psychopaths and that s Voldey s description I wish there d been a little more ingenuity in there I really also dislike Ron I KNOW Travesty But he s a bully He was bullying first year s the whole time turfing tem off chairs scaring them bossing them around taking stuff off them in the name of prefect Like how is that good How is that okay I will not forgive Ron for all this And also the fact that he s a downright BRUTE to Hermione How can I ship them when he s so rude and demeaning to her I DON T Hermione deserves better And I don t buy the She completes him by sorting him out because I think all humans should take responsibility for their actions Hermione shouldn t HAVE to force Ron into a better person and be his conscious AGH Not shipping that Okay I m done But just whispers I hate hate hate Snape So basically YES I had a fantastic time with this book I loved the audio I loved the story I loved Harry and the world just feels so big and rich and visual I get the intense fandom for this I DO GET IT After being so angry and 1000 done in with book 3 I can successfully say I can t WAIT to read the last book now And then watch all the movies And then I ll finally be caught up omg Only took me like 10 years more"

"8","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Apr 02 2015"," Kai","it was amazing"," I am a wizard not a baboon brandishing a stick Harry Potter is my life My life is Harry Potter Once again there are so many great and amazing scenes and quotes pressed between these pages so much truth and emotion How could it not fall for it again and again and again Some of my favourite scenes in no particular order -Fleur and Mrs Weasly falling into each others arms crying just thinking about it makes me teary but no really Fleur is such an amazing and slightly underrated character She lives with the Weasleys where honestly no one makes it easy for her Molly is fighting a constant battle with her but Fleur doesn t back off Everyone is convinced she is vain and arrogant but it s that moment in the hospital wing where - finally - these two amazing women recognise each other as equals where Fleur gains acceptance and much more than that respect Everyone expected her to leave Bill for selfish reasons no one expected that she really truly loves him But by proving that she would stand by him whatever might happen - and everyone knew bad things were going to happen - she opened Molly s eyes and Molly saw her for the first time for what she really was A strong and fierce woman and wife as she was herself -the Memories Dumbledore at the orphanage Tom Riddle visiting Hepzibah Smith and Voldemort coming to ask for the DADA teaching job - The Other Minister is one highly interesting and funny chapter -Dumbledore s visit at the Dursley s-Utter silence before Hermione accidently punches herself with a telescope -Ginny finally getting more spotlight being the sassy and talented witch she is-Hermione pretending to go out with Cormac just to make Ron mad- I expect your trainers are too small Won-Won said a voice behind them and Hermione stalked past smirking -Ron s love potion episode-Harry unknowingly discovering you-know-what while hiding his Potions books in the Room of Requierement -Professor Trelawney actually predicting the right stuff just to dismiss it as rubbish- This is Mr Dumberton- sorry Dunderbore He s come to tell you - well I ll let him do it There are some scenes however that I do not like to read where I have to stop myself from skipping them Firstly the dreadful second Quidditch match secondly the Sectumsempra scene with Malfoy and Snape thirdly Dumbledore suffering in the Cave They are not very enjoyable Something that will forever annoy me is how absolutely no one believes Harry s Malfoy-is-a-Death-Eater theory He keeps telling Ron and Hermione about it but they ignore him And then again do you really expect me to believe that the brightest witch of her age would only get and Exceeds Expectations on her Defence Against The Dark Arts O W L Nope Doesn t make sense Especially not after Dumbledore s Army In a nutshell I love Harry Potter Not sure I mentioned that before Find more of my books on Instagram more"
"9","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Feb 21 2017"," emma","it was amazing"," Reminder that all of my Harry Potter reviews contain unmarked spoilers and lots of em If you re one of the two people on Goodreads who hasn t read this series this review is not for you So my dear underside-of-a-rock-residing friends https emmareadstoomuch wordpress co This review will be interesting because this book was far far far from perfect and yet I am utterly determined to give it 5 stars Which I have only given to the first book in this series God how do you talk about this book It s really amazing It is really hard for me to feel anything while reading a book or generally living my life For example I felt nothing when Sirius died Nothing throughout most of this series actually And nothing in this book because nothing happened and everyone survived and everything is sunshiney and joyful Ugh I tried The last hundred-ish pages of this book really tore me apart Okay even that s not true I ll just come out and say it I m really f cking sad that Dumbledore died I love him so much He s high up in my top 5 characters Do I even have a top 5 I m devastated which makes me even more upset because I have a life to live today and can t just lay around and wallow in fictional pain I m going to move on in the hopes that I just Forget Because I don t like this at ALL Here we see Harry Potter - who I think few will argue has been a fairly mediocre character up to this point - become AMAZING He s motivated solely by his need to work against injustice and evil He realizes his parents legacy within himself He denounces the sucking up of others He works hard in school He is a good friend even when his two BFFS are being childish to one another plus refusing to believe him In short he s really really five-star-level great here Gorgeous character development in 650 pages I didn t think I liked Ginny much because I didn t remember this book well like at all But she is so great So funny I wish there was more of her in this book Also I ll fight anyone who says Dumbledore is the real villain of this series He s really not Cough Snape is cough AND YOU RE NOT EDGY PEOPLE WHO HATE DUMBLEDORE BUT LOVE SNAPE YOU RE JUST DUMB I fell deeply in love with the guy Dumbledore not Snape BLEH AND I F CKING MISS HIM Goddamn it Trying to forget didn t last very long Anyway I missed Hermione and Neville Hermione was absolutely not well-represented here at all Maybe it s a good thing she s not a Ravenclaw RavenclawPride because she works fully against logic throughout this book And when she s not she just like refuses to believe Harry Ron is soooooooooo annoying Is he anyone s favorite character He s like Fred or George if one of them was totally childish and attention-starved and mean In fact Ronald is a pretty impressive character for the number of gross character traits he embodies despite being supposed to be a good character Mean immature rude jealous definition of an inferiority complex Bleh Harry and Ginny I m totally for BUT THE OTHER RELATIONSHIPS IN THIS BOOK ARE SO BORING Can we do Hermione and Fred instead Ron and Luna would be cute Or God forbid some LGBT representation WE KNOW YOU RE A SUPPORTER JOANNE Don t even get me started on Lupin and Tonks Speaking of supposedly-good characters downfalls I m no longer a Hagrid fan It started with the last book and came fully around here Like at a certain point the man needs a character trait Liking weird animals making bad food and being humongous don t count Harry and Hermione s constant stubbornness is annoying Plus makes the plot repetitive once in a while Also Tonks You know what I guess I AM going to get started on Lupin and Tonks She was a hilarious badass in the last book totally depressed and weak in this one I know I sound like a total emotionless asshole here but that s who I am and she s annoying in this book AND IT S TOTALLY FINE BECAUSE SHE S JUST BEING A SPINELESS IDIOT OVER SOME DUMB SHABBY MAN Kill me please Then I can see my beloved Dumbledore again Too much Snape Cannot WAIT to write the rant on him Too much Draco Why do people romanticize that little weirdo so much I guess I get the temptation but he s a bully at best and a spineless traitor at worst I hate Kreacher and I hate Dobby I hated Winky too I might hate house elves If that makes me racist against a species of fictional character SO BE IT I GUESS I miss Fred and George and the fun people from the Order if they existed and Hermione and Neville aren t here nearly enough The price of Harry s amazing and concise character development is WAY too many bad characters not nearly enough of the good ones EXCEPT DUMBLEDORE UGHHHH I M SO SAD I think my inability to cry is making this worse Maybe if I just creepily sobbed in front of my roommate for a few minutes I d feel better Damn you my lack of emotions Just kidding love you But I want to give this book five stars more than anything It was so compulsively readable more than any other book since the first for me And it s the last book where our pals are attending Hogwarts That makes me so sad It s such a gorgeous setting and I m going to miss it so much WHY IS THIS BOOK SO SAD If Deathly Hallows is any sadder I ll be seriously impressed And also seriously screwed And okay even though I was a harsh critic of these books I m really going to miss this series I ve been rereading it on and off obviously for three months and it s been a fun ride This is one of the greatest settings of all time And since I m rereading it after 10 years it s like saying goodbye twice AND I HATE ENDINGS Bottom line Okay THIS is my favorite Harry Potter book Anyone else s Unreal character development tragic and lovely adieu to a gorgeous setting ability to make me feel real deep emotion compulsively readable An absolute dream ----------ORIGINAL REVIEW---------------Ron and Hermione s will-they-won t-they is a total snoozefest I propose Fred Hermione and Ron Luna instead Also seven more books more"

my - nee croaked Ron unexpectedly from between them but all my anger was gone when he was poisoned and he said that while he was asleep I think he was trying to say Hermione so that meant he dreamt about her and I forgave him that exact time and he also didn t really like Lavender anymore since then he even pretended to be asleep when Lavender came to visit him in the hospital wing so that meant he didn t like her anymore and I don t think he actually liked Lavender before he was poisoned I think he just kissed Lavender because he wanted to make Hermione jealous and feel hurt which he successfully did Harry And Ginny have you ever thought why Ginny had relationship with quite many guys wait not many guys because she just dated two boys Dean and Michael But she always got a boyfriend as soon as she split up with her ex and my thoughs about this is probably right because Ginny said this to Harry on the end of the book I never really gave up on you she said Not really I always hoped Hermione told me to get on with life maybe go out with some other people relax a bit around you because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the room remember And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more - myself I think Ginny always dated a guy as soon as she split up with her ex because she always tried to forget Harry so maybe if she had a boyfriend she wouldn t love Harry anymore But according to what she said she never really gave up on Harry so that means she has always loved him I was a bit sad when Harry said they can t be together again because Harry was afraid if something would happen to Ginny if they kept seeing each other he was afraid if Voldemort used Ginny to get him but I didn t angry with him because this just proved how much Harry loves Ginny and I am sure they will be together again I hope so Dumbledore s death I admit that Dumbledore is not one of my top favorite characters in this series but I always found him funny and a bit weird in a good way of course But his death left me in shock because he was actually pleading to Snape but Snape killed him with The Avada Kedavra curse and I thought Snape was on the good side What will happen now after Dumbledore died He is the only one Voldemort is afraid of I have this feeling that I ll to lose my favorite characters again thank you so much for reading and liking my review hope you all have a great weekend guys more"

"15","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Jul 31 2012"," Evgeny","it was amazing"," Harry Potter s sixth year at Hogwarts With Lord Voldemort on the loose things are going very bad in wizard community all the troubles spill in the Muggle world Unsurprisingly the book begins with a chapter with real Muggle Prime Minister - somewhat unnecessary I might add If you think you can find anything original in this review you are sadly mistaken It is practically impossible to find anything new to say after literally everybody and their brother read and discussed the series Still it was interesting to see some people try to pretend everything is fine and perfect Hermione and Ron firmly fall into this category while others like Harry being obsessed with suspecting other people - in Harry s case his suspicions of Draco Malfoy made him practically paranoid and acting retarded at times Some spoilers follow Is it still possible to find anybody who have not read the series or watched the movies If you are one of such rarities stop right here Harry and Ginny romance came out of nowhere and feels very artificial My old cynical self does not think Ginny is a good match for Harry Why would anybody want to have a girlfriend whose only positive quality is to throw hexes around - for little or no reasons I might add Hermione on the other hand was always there for Harry Another complaint is fairly big and I will use spoiler tags for it The underground lake scene view spoiler this came out really stupid for me You had to drink the liquid to get the locket You could not just reach it with you hand fine You could scoop the water with a goblet Why not pour it out instead of drinking hide spoiler Yet another big one Snape view spoiler Now that I know what is going on reading the second chapter I quite agree with Harry he is probably the bravest man of the series hide spoiler The tragedy at the end still feels like a read tragedy during the reread while the impact of what happened at the end of the previous book considerably lessened when I read it the second time So all the nitpicks aside I still rate this book with a perfect rating it is well worth it P S I always wanted to say it in one of the reviews for a book of the series this feels like a good place when it comes to movies Richard Harris beats the crap out of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore I am not questioning the acting abilities of the latter but the former suited to the role much better I leave you with the following more"

"21","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Mar 27 2018","","2018 Lily is currently reading it"," Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is probably my favorite book in the Harry Potter series right after Order of the Phoenix so suffice it to say that re-reading this book inspired a lot of feelings If you haven t read HBP yet what are you doing with your life you should exit this review because it is filled with spoilers Musings highlights Does anyone else ever visit Snape and am I the only person who wondered about this when Bellatrix and Narcissa showed up at his house Dumbledore putting the Dursleys in their place is iconic This scene I m not tearing up at all you are while I was at the Dursleys interrupted Harry his voice growing stronger I realized I can t shut myself away or or crack up Sirius wouldn t have wanted that would he And anyway life s too short Look at Madam Bones look at Emmeline Vance It could be me next couldn t it But if it is he said fiercely now looking straight into Dumbledore s blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight I ll make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me as I can and Voldemort too if I can manage it Dumbledore s quote about forgiveness people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right Luna being Luna aka my fave the Weasley twins ahhh Snape continues to be utterly detestful and a horrible human being all around McGonagall praising Neville honestly warmed my heart tbc and our trip down nostalgia lane continues buddy reread with my favorite Hufflepuff 3 more"

"23","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Jan 07 2012"," James","really liked it"," Book Review 4 out of 5 stars to Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince the 6th book in the Young Adult Fantasy series written in 2005 by J K Rowling Although I could go on and on about this book there are so many other reviews and reviewers who are likely to have a better one simply because they wrote it write after reading the book or watching the movie I read it close to ten years ago saw the movie at least 5 years ago and though I would love to re-read them my TBR pile is way too high That said it s a fantastic series full of wild imagination great beauty and intricate sentiment In this book Harry must connect with the past and his dark side trying to figure out who this half-blood prince is and when he finds out everything is different The book is about relationships discovering things about yourself and others that you didn t know And when someone Harry absolutely adores is murdered right in front of him and it s connected with the half-blood prince it sends Harry on a downward spiral out of control but necessary for him to find the inner strength to fight Lord Voldemort I can t even begin to write a review for this book let s just go get some coffee or a drink and talk about it It requires us having an animated conversation right About Me For those new to me or my reviews here s the scoop I read A LOT I write A LOT And now I blog A LOT First the book review goes on Goodreads and then I send it on over to my WordPress blog at https thisismytruthnow com where you ll also find TV Film reviews the revealing and introspective 365 Daily Challenge and lots of blogging about places I ve visited all over the world And you can find all my social media profiles to get the details on the who what when where and my pictures Leave a comment and let me know what you think Vote in the poll and ratings Thanks for stopping by more"

"32","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Jan 28 2016"," Liza","it was amazing"," My heart is shattering as I finish this phenomenal book I was nervous to read it again because as it was my favourite the first time I read the series I was anxious to see if maybe I would be let down I completely understand why this was my favourite of the series and still so far is I connect the most with the characters and the feelings that they are faced with throughout this book I am bawling my eyes out as I write this review and with good reason The death of Dumbledore is earth shattering and the grave nature of this situation is delivered perfectly This book is the darkest I believe of the series as Voldemort s reign begins to take place The fear and frustration is eminent throughout every word however there is lightheartedness throughout Delving into Voldemort s past is one of the unique aspects portrayed in this book It s incredibly fascinating to learn the history of the darkest wizard of all time There is so much we learn and so much more we can guess about him which is the sign of a great writer J K Rowling allows the reader to figure things out on their own and take their own ideas from what she gives It is impossible to lose interest as you discover more and more of this story However the biggest and most prominent reason of why this book speaks to me so deeply is because of Draco Malfoy This is his story his book no matter how many ways one can look at it He is so complex very smart troubled hurt confused misunderstood but nevertheless strong in his beliefs He loves his family and will do anything to protect them Something that I didn t notice the first time I read the books which I can see now is that Draco is skilled at hiding his thoughts from intruders which means that he is skilled in Occlumency I adore him and it s crazy how one can learn so many things about their favourite character that they didn t know before just by paying attention to detail This chills me to my core I connect with him on so many levels and although this is odd to many people because they see him as a villain he is not and I truly respect him with everything I have He knows love perhaps more than even Harry as he is willing to do what it takes to protect his family He deserves a chance just like so many others as there are many layers to his character There is so much that I can say about him but I will keep it at that I will always cherish this story with all my might This book destroys me in the best possible ways more"

"48","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Jun 29 2012"," Amy shoutame","it was amazing"," Pleasantly surprised by this re-read I ve always considered HP and the Half Blood Prince to be one of my least favourites of the series - but this time I had a completely different experience I had forgotten how much of Voldemort s past Dumbledore and Harry go into which is missed out in the film and found that to be the most engaging part of the story Brilliant A real hit of nostalgia Hermione was also rocking it - she is by far my favourite out of the main three characters I don t think she gets enough credit for how awesome she is more"
"49","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Jan 24 2017"," Iryna Book and Sword","really liked it"," Here are just some of my thoughts about the book - I liked it better when it was Luna who found Harry in the train compartment probably only one of very few things I liked better in the movie than in the book I just think Luna deserved more page space than she got in this book - Where was Slughorn when everybody else was fighting the death eaters - I read reviews that said that Dumbledore should have just poured the poison on the ground instead of drinking it but judging by it I think it would have just refilled itself However that is my speculation and it would have been nicer to see it have actually said something about that in the book to close that loop-hole - I adored Fleur s reaction to Bill s injuries It was amazing and brought tears to my eyes To see that she was actually scared that he might not love her after this but never waiving in her love for him - I am sure this has been said million times but book s Ginny is simply fantastic Ginny grew up with Fred and George so of course she turned out to be brave daring and fiery I only wish the movie could have displayed it properly She adds a nice touch and it is only proper to give Harry who is a teenager a love interest Otherwise it would have been unrealistic really for almost all of us meet our first love in school - I was getting really bored of them doing their homework getting to classes doing homework walking to classes thinking of classes You get the drill I just feel like if I was Harry and I knew that the fate of my friend s and the world in whole is basically in my hands I wouldn t worry so much about doing homework No normal teenager would Draco actually was the only one who was acting sensible in this case saying that O W L s and N E W T s won t matter anymore - It was hard to see Ron being a bully and a prat but I think his behavior was completely normal for a teenager who have never been kissed and just got bullied by his little sister about it I think Rowling portrayed raging teenager emotions very well in these last two books - As sad as it was I appreciated Harry panicking at the lake and losing his head It showed him as a regular and ordinary person once more to prove a point that we all make mistakes and that nobody is a super hero My WEBSITEMy INSTAGRAMMy WORDPRESS BLOG more"

"62","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Aug 23 2016"," Sonia","it was amazing"," Dado que Goodreads ha borrado mi rese a de este mi libro favorito de la saga y aunque ha pasado un a o desde que lo le me pareci importante intentar recordar lo que ese d a puse por escrito sobre lo que pensaba y sent a acerca de este libro y hacerlo de nuevo aunque probablemente me quede corta en comparaci n con el d a que ten a esta lectura m s fresca Sin embargo no siento que haya pasado demasiado tiempo En este punto de la saga ya todo el mundo se da cuenta de lo elaborado de esta historia De todas las tramas que se unifican y de todos los trasfondos que constituyen a los personajes para hacerlos tan reales como sea posible Aqu todo m s oscuro y dif cil nos sumerge la autora en dif ciles explicaciones sobre el desenlace que podr a tener esta secuencia de acontecimientos y el destino de cada uno de los que forman parte de ellos Est demasiado bien trazado y hace que nos importe No queda nada por fuera todo est tan bien atado que la cadena de historias parece convertirse en un c rculo con el que uno termina familiariz ndose Al final todo se conecta En este tomo las cosas han cambiado mucho Harry regresa a Hogwarts pero la situaci n no es la misma Aqu se profundiza much simo m s en muchos aspectos y se esclarecen algunas circunstancias en las que la seguridad de los personajes se ve amenazada y creo que por tal raz n salen a relucir muchas cosas que antes no ve amos Surgen situaciones bastante cotidianas aun en medio del caos y es divertido ver c mo se alternan estos episodios tan comunes con los momentos m s serios La rutina no se detiene y es precisamente en medio de la vida estudiantil en la que Harry descubre un elemento esencial y de mucha importancia en la historia y aunque al principio solo le da un toque emocionante e interesante a los d as de Harry como alumno al final se vuelve pr cticamente el centro de todo y es donde se hallan algunas explicaciones El final fue un choque en definitiva Hubo partes muy dif ciles y muy tristes pero nunca dej de ser esa emocionante monta a rusa que nos conduc a por los rincones m s insospechados y misteriosos de ese mundo que uno se podr a imaginar Hubo tambi n mucha alegr a en compensaci n por los malos ratos y eso no es algo que pase yo por alto Es un libro que inevitablemente causa mucha impresi n Sucedieron much simas cosas y tan de prisa A veces ni siquiera daba tiempo de reaccionar porque se suced an los acontecimientos de una forma vertiginosa Parte de ellos muy tristes Muy dolorosos Los personajesQu encantadores Por Dios qu encantadores No solo aquellos que hicieron cosas buenas todo el tiempo porque ese es el punto fueron tan reales que todos absolutamente todos cometieron errores terribles alguna vez o tuvieron pensamientos errados incluso sobre personas a las que quer an Hubo tanto de una cosa y de otra tanto de la vida cotidiana de estudiantes y tambi n de personas poco comunes que se enfrentaron con una oscuridad pensada invencible y al final pudieron sostenerse entre estos dos mundos de normalidad y oscuridad con un equilibrio admirable Y creo que fue todo por la compa a que ten an Porque se ten an los unos a los otros Hubo esa t pica envidia y esos celos comunes entre compa eros inseparables disputas tontas entre amigos de verdad competitividad peleas celebraciones cuestiones adolescentes y eso me caus una profunda calidez al leer este libro Me gust porque a fin de cuentas las personas no son cobardes o valientes sino que pueden tener momentos de ambas dependiendo de la situaci n en la que se encuentren y de lo mucho que a ellos les importe Me gust porque ten a a estas dos chicas tan diferentes pero al final tan valientes Ginny y Hermione y que hicieron de la lectura algo ameno y que disfrut mucho leer Mis favoritas Tan inteligentes con la dosis justa de independencia pero tambi n de la vulnerabilidad que las hace chicas Me gust porque se ten an Sobre todo por esa unidad inquebrantable incorruptible Eso hizo de este libro mi favorito de la saga Pese a las p rdidas los errores las malas decisiones se ten an y eso nunca cambi aunque les pusieran el mundo al rev s Aunque les sacudieran desde los cimientos se ten an No llegu a odiar a nadie Todos se mostraron tan humanos en cierto momento Hasta los que hac an las peores cosas estaban llenos de fragilidad y ten an esa esencia de personas con una debilidad en espec fico que les conduc a a actuar de tal o cual forma Aunque muchas de sus acciones no eran justificables tampoco carec an de fundamento Todas ellas con un origen una ra z buena o mala Ah estaba Con una historia Injustas a veces pero muy fundamentadas En este espacio hace un a o habl de lo mucho que me hab a resistido a leer esta saga Aqu hace un a o habl de la de veces que me hab an insistido hasta que finalmente ced y hasta ahora no me arrepiento porque he aprendido sobre una gran escritora De las cualidades tan marcadas que el mundo en general tiene y no deber a o de las que s y de las que no tiene pero deber a desear adquirir Mis respetos a Rowling more"
"63","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Feb 02 2014"," Jonathan Janz","it was amazing"," Here s the thing about the Harry Potter books They re awesome Deep huh Well deep or shallow it s the truth I waited a long time to read the Harry Potter books because I wanted to experience them with my own children My son 8 and I just finished the sixth book my first daughter 6 and I are working on the first and my youngest child 3 is content to commandeer her siblings wands and run around shrieking I have a Harry Potter stick In other words we all enjoy it I could write a great deal about Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince but it s a tough book to write about without giving things away And though I loved this novel for many reasons I find it quite difficult to separate it from the other tales This I think speaks to J K Rowling s ability to connect the stories in a such a way that they each have their own identity while still continuing to trace a gigantic glowing arc through the sky along which the reader is able to ride from the first book to the seventh So before I tell you a few things I loved about the novel please know that there might be spoilers below Not huge spoilers mind you but I m always afraid of letting something slip So be forewarned Don t read on if you haven t read this book yet And if you haven t read the book why are you reading a review of it by a writer whose skills don t yet approach J K Rowling s Seriously Get off the danged Internet and read this amazing series Some delights and terrors and sorrows 1 Fenrir Greyback Bet that surprised you a little I know that this character played a relatively minor role but on the page he was a scene-stealer a flesh-chewer and a perfect foil for one of my favorite character Remus Lupin An aside About a year before I began reading the series my Creative Writing class was discussing characterization The kids began talking about the Harry Potter books One remarked that the supporting characters were as interesting as the leads which led another student to bring up Remus Lupin She was halfway through her cataloging of his merits as a character when she stopped and looked up at me as if seeing me anew She then said Mr Insert real name here You sort of remind me of Lupin When I later found out he was a werewolf I was a little bit shocked and secretly pleased But when I really got to know the character I found the remark incredibly gratifying Back to Fenrir Greyback with whom I hope I have nothing in common What made Greyback so incredibly interesting to me was not only the sheer ferocity of his behavior but the diabolical simplicity of his motives If the Harry Potter books were likened to Lord of the Flies and Voldemort s ambition were compared with Jack s the leader of the hunters then Greyback would be Roger the sadist This powderkeg of a character lives only to rend flesh and to guzzle the steaming lifeblood of his victims Greyback doesn t want to rule the world he simply wants to terrorize it I don t know what kind of a role he plays in the seventh book if any but his unreasoning brutality added just the right note of menace to a book that largely---and sensitively---focused on the romantic relationships of its teenagers 2 Fleur s Surprising Reaction I admit to falling prey to a stupid prejudice here and I feel awful about it But I wrongly assumed Fleur Delacour was a pretty face without a soul In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire she was the object of many male desires Ron s particularly and though she was skilled at wizardry she wasn t an especially affecting character She did seem affected however and when she showed up again in Book Six I like Mrs Weasley rolled my eyes and dismissed her as a fluttery vapid future supermodel How wrong I was One mark of a great writer I think is the ability to surprise the reader without cheating That s J K Rowling When something terrible befell Fleur s fiance I was all set to mentally berate her for her superficiality But rather than making a caricature out of Fleur---as I fear I unknowingly did---Rowling transformed her and made her deeply endearing with a couple elegant lines of dialogue And I loved that So here s to continual reminders to not judge people by appearances or even their seeming personalities People can still surprise us and we need to give them the opportunity to do so takes a deep breath And lastly 3 Dumbledore If you ve read this far you ve only been assailed by minor spoilers I don t want to spoil this plot twist but I don t know how to talk about it without spoiling it And the fact is I don t want to talk about it Rarely has a fictional character so resonated with me the way Albus Dumbledore has In the first book he was wise eccentric and a constant source of comfort As the series has developed he has persisted in exhibiting those traits but he has also grown more than most might think He has revealed a penchant for trusting others too much He has admitted how fallible he is how prone to mistakes He has been injured accused of wrongdoing and generally fed through a physical and emotional woodchipper And he has come through it all with an open caring heart and an enormous capacity for love One passage in particular I think summarizes this amazing character for me In a scene that chronicles how Tom Riddle became Lord Voldemort Dumbledore attempts to gird Harry s resolve and confidence in the inevitable battle with his nemesis Yes you have said Dumbledore firmly You have a power that Voldemort has never had You can--- I know said Harry impatiently I can love It was only with difficult that he stopped himself adding Big deal Yes Harry you can love said Dumbledore who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying Which given everything that has happened to you is a great and remarkable thing You are still too young to understand how unusual you are Harry So when the prophecy says that I ll have power the Dark Lord knows not it just means---love asked Harry feeling a little let down Yes---just love said Dumbledore The above passage will strike some as too direct too naive or worst of all too emotional It struck me as incredibly beautiful There are all sorts of belief systems in the world and no two people are exactly alike in their beliefs But what Dumbledore says here is something that were it adopted by more people would alter our world for the better Harry for all his flaws usually acts with good intentions He befriends Luna Lovegood another one of my favorite characters in all of fiction gives of himself to others and is willing to suffer so that others won t have to experience the same pain In other words Harry loves And so can Dumbledore Which is why this book was so memorable wonderful and painful to me I m going to go now My wife is making a delicious supper My son and first daughter are ready to wrestle And my three-year-old is racing around the house casting spells on the furniture with her Harry Potter stick And for that J K Rowling I thank you more"

"71","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Dec 16 2012"," Erin Proud Book Hoarder","really liked it"," When you have seen as much of life as I have you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love Here J K Rowling was getting me used to longer books but for this one she trimmed off a few hundred pages Honestly the story didn t contain as much in some ways as the previous two that were longer so the page length fit it It s that semi-awkward stage book where it s going to lead to the last big-bang fight and wrap-up has to introduce new stuff for the story but play on the old without wrapping that up just yet Harry has lost his mope from Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix feeling accepted again amongst his peers and not left out in the dark any longer but he retains the natural anger and fear that he should have in his circumstance There s some mini developments between him and a female character romantically wise which to me fits the series well Hermione and Ron also are leaning toward each other more even if they haven t made it officially official just yet If you re a fan of Dumbledore this book will both please and infuriate you He s in more scenes than ever while he gives Harry private lessons showing both his and other people s memories all leading to a fascinating backstory focusing on Voldemort You don t actually get to see the monstrous villain in this book - you only hear about him which is typical of the earlier installments There s a few death eaters popping up though including Fenrir a new big-bad I hadn t noticed before a demented werewolf of all things Can I just say this guy is actually creepy Especially his focus on hurting and turning children As always these books are impossible to put down since Rowling s writing technique not only rocks but she gives us unique characters who are individuals standing out from each other while working toward standing together unified Rowling always introduces a new stand-out character in books here it s a new potions master who enjoys fame and getting to know students who he has determined are going places Dumbledore has something else up his sleeve about this teacher too Pacing wise it s okay as this book is more of a filler than anything but it does give us one big revelation concerning Voldemort All the other books pointed toward this but it s now more obvious coming together when Harry sees the larger picture While a stepping stone to the next book The Half-Blood Prince is in no way boring You get to see Harry with his friends and relationships a little in the classes and especially wondering who on earth the Half-Blood prince is That mystery intrigued me since I couldn t figure it out for awhile and I d forgotten since watching the movie years back While the new potions teacher is introduced Snape finally gets his turn at Defense against the Dark Arts I was slightly bummed we didn t get to see more time spent in his class however I ve always enjoyed the classroom teaching and experiences in the other books and here was a chance to see freaking SNAPE of all people talking about the dark arts Unfortunately there s just the one classroom moment Although we don t see too much on the teaching side Snape is still brilliantly constructed and a page-stealer when he comes on scene As with the previous book there s a heartbreaking ending to this one so have the tissues handy I ll keep them handy when I go on to the next and last book where I know more depressing stuff will happen And of course I ll need tissues just knowing it s the last book and that it s time to get off this ride more"
"72","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Jul 26 2007"," J G Keely","it was ok"," After the loss of the admittedly occasionally interminable dark psychological tone of the last book this one falls into a very recognizable plot coupon pattern which should be familiar to anyone who played D D or watched Dragonball we were all 11 once right Of course constructing the finale around such a simple and direct concept for the ending of the conflict is easy for the author However it is formulaic and predictable for the reader and robs us of actually seeing a physical and intellectual struggle between foes Of course this does not mean that they do not strive against one another but by providing the separation of such a plot device relocates the entire point-of-conflict to an arbitrary external point Thermal exhaust port indeed For more on such plot-specific concepts please enjoy this article http www ansible co uk Ansible plot This book was mainly built to set up the finale and feels in many ways to be less of a complete story than a second in a trilogy without a real point and ending of its own and reliant on the final chapter to decide its importance This is also the book with the greatest adherence to actually surprising the audience with a main character death At least it would be if it weren t unfortunately easy to match the emotional directives given to the characters by the author and recognize that what the author wants us to think shows us precisely what will happen Misdirection is an art but it should not have to be a martial one Long story short I unfortunately guessed the twist and spent the greater part of this book watching the author try to throw red herrings in my path A bit disappointing but still a fairly interesting and exciting tale The historical and character exploration provide some of the strongest elements in any of her books It does not quite reach the heights in tone emotion or motivation of the last book but she never does reach that height again My Fantasy Book Suggestions more"

"100","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Jun 24 2012"," Sara","it was amazing"," My favourite book of the series I love how it ties so neatly with Chamber of Secrets all the little references and backstory to support the Horcrux theory I particularly loved the interactions between Harry and Dumbledore who seems to approach Harry with something other than just a boy who needs protecting He s finally privy to Dumbledores secrets and suspicions and is treated like an equal I love the Voldemort back story I hate that they missed everything regarding Merope out in the movies Merope is such a pitiful figure - abused ruthlessly by her father and brother woefully neglected to the point that her whole life seems worthless Is it any wonder she escaped at the first opportunity and essentially gave into her fantasy of a loving caring family I still cry every time at that ending too It s a good set up for the final novel as we see Harry and co branch out on their own There s no one to protect Harry anymore more"
"101","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Jun 17 2009"," Stuart Douglas","did not like it"," There is an popular school of thought which says that as soon as an author becomes very successful in the sense that people might actually buy their books rather than the Guardian Review section stating the author has a narrative voice reminiscent of early Banana Yoshimoto it is pure intellectual snobbery to claim that he or she is nowhere near as talented as is generally suggested and that other far more obscure writers are considerably better and more worthy of adulation This is of course sometimes true but in general it s just so much hot air designed to help people avoid any actual thinking about whatever it is that they re reading and to instead continue to believe that high book sales are a sure fire sign of literary quality In fact extremely popular authors tend to fall into two categories First and best are those writers who are genuinely very good at all levels of what they do Terry Pratchett for the fantasy sf crowd Marian Keyes for the chick-litters and so on - their writing is solid and well-done their ideas are witty and original their characters within the scope of their chosen genre rounded and believable In general no-one tends to come out and say Terry Pratchett is a very poor writer of dialogue for the simple reason that evidently he isn t The second group are those authors who really aren t very good at writing but who can churn out intriguing if often illogical plots which hold the attention in much the same way that soap operas do Jeffrey Archer although apparently a self-serving ex-criminal is the most obvious example of this second breed as a teenager I once read Archer s Kane and Abel whilst on a family holiday in a B B in Fort William and it was perfectly acceptable stuff - certainly much more attention-grabbing than the pile of Zane Grey westerns which were the place s only other literary offerings People frequently do come out and say things like Jeffrey Archer is a very poor writer of dialogue which is fair enough comment because equally evidently he is exactly that Which is not to say that he can t tell a story - and that is an accusation not often levelled at him All of which apparent digression brings me to JK Rowling s penultimate Harry Potter book Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince One in three hardbacks sold in the UK are written by Ms Rowling and if the papers are to be believed she made 20 million in the first day of sale of this novel The series regularly tops reader polls as best children s books ever and Ms Rowling is now the richest woman in Britain possibly the Universe She was even it is rumoured invited by Russell T Davies to write a story for the rebirth of smsh hit tv series Doctor Who To suggest that Ms Rowling is a less than stellar writer and that - for instance - Ursula K LeGuin s Earthsea trilogy is so far above Harry Potter as to be invisible is presumably just the type of intellectual snobbery mentioned above And yet her new book is - and apologies in advance for the profanity - bloody awful So awful that it would never have been published had it been written by anyone other than JKR So awful that even the sycophantic drone at Bloomsbury who ahem edits the Rowling manuscripts must have winced So awful that even the author appears to recognise that she s putting no effort in any more So awful that everyone involved should be throughly ashamed of themselves The Half-Blood Prince has the story s hero spending much of his time several hundred pages in fact doing something which does not need doing simply in order a to have him doing anything at all and b waste some time Dumbledore clearly already knows what has passed between Professor Slughorn and Lord Voldemort so there is no need for Harry to spend so much time on the subject other than artificially boosting the pagecount What makes this particuarly galling is that Rowling knows that what she s doing is rubbish - there s even an explicit reference to the fact that the hero need not have been Harry but could just as easily have been the ineffectual Neville We should however really be glad that Rowling s third-rate rip-off of the Origins of Gollum section of Lord of the Rings which makes up much of the plot and which is the supposed reason for Harry s enquiries of Slughorn does take up such an incredibly large part of the book as it at least prevents Rowling shoe-horning in yet more tedious badly written and shallow bits of teenage love and snogging This is a book bought mainly by ten to fourteen year olds after all and if they want romantic teen angst they can presumably go out and buy a Jacqueline Wilson book rather than this hand-me-down tat In any case once the Lord Voldemort is Smeagol and Harry meets Ginny sections are over there s only about 150 pages left of the 607 page book and we re heading helter-skelter for the Obligatory Dead Hero section of the book - by my count this is the third book in a row where one of the good guys is killed Surprisingly perhaps given the emotional impact Rowling managed to put into the death of Sirius Black in the last book the O D H here is just as poorly done as the rest of the book and although you can easily conjecture ways in which the scene might make more sense and have a greater impact in light of the final book in the series it s very hard to care enough to try Which is something of an achievement in itself when you re talking about the death of a key and sympathetic character the reader has been following for five previous books Which leaves the mystery of just who is the Half-Blood Prince Who cares The solution in the end is a Pull-the-Never-Mentioned-Previously-Rabbit-Out-the-Hat affair that you couldn t possibly have guessed given the available evidence but it doesn t matter because you won t care The character of the Half-Blood Prince once revealed is neither believable nor interesting nor even very necessary It s just more page-filler saying in fifty thousand words what a good writer could have said in fifteen not 15 thousand just 15 Harry is tempted to cut corners and can be a little bit bad sometimes - there you go that s only 14 and I m not a writer of any description As someone recently mentioned on one of the mailing lists I frequent the whole Harry thinks Snape is up to no good Ron and Hermoine aren t sure and Dumbledore isn t saying shtick is now well past its sell-by date and increasingly seems to be the only idea Rowling has for a Potter book Here that idea reaches a potential conclusion and frankly I was bored stupid by just how lacklustre lazy and badly done it all was more"

"122","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Dec 01 2017"," Larissa Book Bosomed Blonde","really liked it"," This review can also be found HereActual rating 4 5Wow That is going to be my word for this book because it totally wowed me Honestly i was feeling really disappointed after finishing Order of the Phoenix and i was wondering is this it for me and Harry Potter books but oh no this book was unputdownable i just couldn t get enough of it Everything that was lacking from the last book came back into this one and i am so pleased J K Rowling found her groove again and the writing style is completely gripping I like how she started off the book from a couple of different POV s to really hook us in and make us want to know what the heck is going on She gave away just enough information from those perspectives to make us literally question everything throughout the book and i loved that mystique element to the writing The humour is also back in this one and I m so glad The last book was so gloomy and put me in a dispiriting mood and even though this book is far from Happy-go-lucky it had some hilarious and beautiful moments that befitted the story Another thing that is greatly touched upon in this book is the magical elements We get a lot more of in-class scenes that focus on learning different magic and it s probably one of my favourite parts I just love learning along with the rest of the class and seeing how all the different paths work together There is a significant chunk of this book where Harry is learning a lot more in potions and i found it so fascinating to read those parts because in previous books the actual potion making is on the back burner and it s mostly focused on how Harry hates those classes because of Snape You can also tell that the characters are getting older and maturing by the raging hormones throughout this book There s fights drama love and typical hormonal teenage stuff that really adds to the realistic qualities of the book It s not all just about magic or dark arts these are real teenagers going through the same ups and downs we have all experienced in life The characters really do come into themselves in this instalment We already know who are main characters are and their surface qualities however this book takes it a step further than the rest and really gets nitty gritty into the raw emotions of our beloved characters We learn a lot more about them and i got to say its really great Not only do we get more of our main characters but we finally get more Ginny Who i personally really like she s smart witty and a great person Finally her character is expanded upon My favourite part of this book is the meetings between Harry and Dumbledore For the most part Dumbledore has only really come into the books towards the end and it s always as more of a role model figure towards Harry Now we get to see them as sort of friends and it s really amazing to see the bond between them Also Dumbledore is pretty badass he s not just the humble old man we ve seen in previous books and i am thrilled that we get to see him in action What actually takes place at these meetings is also what makes these encounters my favourite We get so much more information on what and why things are going the way they are and its done in such a clever manner Through conversations J K Rowling has totally dumped a gargantuan amount of information on us but made it to feel natural Although overwhelming at times she did it in a way that you would come across in real life and made it to be engaging rather than off-putting She is such a clever writer and it comes across in the best of ways I honestly have such a fondness for this book and i can t decide whether i like this one or Prisoner of Azkaban better The writing plot characters and magic all comes together to make for one amazing read If you re having trouble getting through any of the other books trust me it s worth it to get to this one Larissa more"

"127","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Feb 27 2018"," Bianca","it was amazing"," The beginning of this book really marks the turn of Harry reaching adulthood We learn a lot about the background of Voldemort and how he came to be evil I remember reading this book the day it came out and refusing to believe that Dumbledore had actually been killed I flew through the pages so sure that it was just a trick It marked the moment that no character was truly safe My favourite part of this book happens in the hospital wing at the end of the story Fleur s declaration and Mrs Weasley s acceptance of her along with the truth about Tonks and Lupin being revealed I d actually forgotten that Harry broke up with Ginny at the end of the story shows I ve been watching the movies too much Despite the ending it was a bit of a slow book But every page sets up the events that will follow in the next book more"

"129","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Mar 20 2010"," Trish","it was amazing"," In Harry s 6th year at Hogwarts many things happen We have the complex love lives of nearly every student I had almost forgotten that Harry s and Ginny s first kiss was in this book and not in the Room Of Requirement as in the movie but in the Common Room in front of all of Gryffindor This is of course the main focus of the movie To me the movie adaptation of this book is the worst of them all since it almost exclusively focuses on the teenagers love affairs instead of on at least one of the other exceedingly important issues such as the discoveries regarding Voldemort s past I loved travelling through time thanks to the pensieve trying to get Professor Slughorn s memory even against his will or the quest for the titular Half-Blood Prince I remember not having had read the book before seeing the movie for the first time and being extremely confused the first few seconds after the Half-Blood Prince revealed himself This journey following all the clues seeing how much Harry actually learns which gives him and Snape a cool dynamic and a new twist on the dark arts was highly enjoyable The only thing they really showed in perfect likeness and gave enough screen time in the movie was the twins joke shop Oh and then there is also the whole Dobby-and-Creature-dynamic which was hilarious and quite important although we only get to see that in the next book And let s not forget the story between Harry and Creature what with the whole inheritance from Sirius All that before the background of ever more numerous disappearances and killings Voldemort gaining more and more influence and dread spreading but also some funny quirky happenings like the apparition test where Ron leaves behind half an eyebrow or the incident with the love potion on Ron s birthday or Aragog s burial or the constant bickering between the Weasley women and Fleur or Luna commentating the Quidditch match which has to be one of the funniest things ever Overall the atmosphere in the book despite everything that is going on in the outside world is much more homely again Especially in comparison to the previous volume this is not just a stark contrast but also a welcome relief Well at least until the shocking and dark conclusion By the way view spoiler Harry and Hagrid finding Dumbledore lying on the ground - and the students coming outside and seeing the body as well - after the Death Eaters have gone is at least as bad as the actual moment of death apart from Fawkes lament maybe sobs But the impact of the movie scene when everyone raises their wand to illuminate the night is still the most profound the book cannot rival that hide spoiler In this context it is so immensely sweet how the author through Molly and Fleur and McGonagall makes her point that especially when the world is dark love is what is needed the most sniffles A brilliant way Rowling showed how much Harry has grown up probably without realizing it himself was the discussion with Scrimgeour the new Minister for Magic at the Burrow and later at the funeral What is more it was a great way to simultaneously show the ambiguity of the wizarding world - the supposed good guys doing more and more unforgivable things with the excuse of just reacting to the new threat Sneaky and significant on many levels and as comparing the time of this book s publication with current times shows the writing seems to never lose its significance Harry also learns a lot from the lessons with Dumbledore and I m not talking about the contents of the memories now it s rather his way of thinking and plotting and finally connecting the dots and realizing the role he has to play though not entirely just yet Not to forget his realization that there is a difference between having to fight and choosing to do so with your head held high In this book then we get more action than ever before yes I m thinking of the extremely impressive cave scene and the fight with the Death Eaters that was severely downplayed in the movie more riddles than before more entanglements As the children in the series are growing up so are the readers and so the themes get darker and more complex too It is another stroke of genius on Rowling s part Just like the casually strewn hints that in retrospect lead to so much more than just the main story here as we discover now when watching the Fantastic Beasts movies The world she has created has so much depth one could drown in it And it doesn t stop there as I know from several interviews the author has given If I wasn t so determined to complete the series and see all the threads coming together I might need a few days of respite after the immense loss we have to cope with at the end of this book But alas Onwards P S It really was a shame that they didn t show the funeral in the movie I especially liked the Centaurs and Merpeople s contribution more"

"131","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," May 04 2015"," Steve","it was amazing"," Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the most complex multi-layered and emotional book of series so far After a slow start the momentum picks up like a snow ball rolling down an icy cliff until a the breathtaking unnerving and unflinching climax Rowling stays true to form the entire ride The characters become deeper and more thoughtful in a well-written book of imagination and originality Rowling doesn t dumb down her characters she illustrates them as they should be as real complicated teenagers As such Harry Ron and Hermione and to some extent Ginny have matured considerably since the previous book They are now older teenagers and are developing strong ties to the opposite sex Ultimately the central theme is discovering who Lord Voldemort really is Much is learned about Voldemort in this novel a brilliant setup for what will most likely be a spectacular showdown in the final novel There are other subplots galore of course that I m guessing will tie up the various loose ends in book 7 This book is not rushed it has no rushed ending It is filled with insight and emotion It is a much darker and much more adult book especially the last quarter of the book Obviously the novel is a setup for the final showdown It leaves the reader hanging off of a cliff but it is written with beauty and flawless description Rowling gives her audience a realistic portrait of human souls in a fantasy world I felt more character depth in this novel than any of the others Besides all the beauty and imagination this book is relentless transcending the level mere entertainment It gives depth and wonder It expands on the characters not just the events It has the usual mind-boggling wonders and creative new inventions The ending was incredibly moving and sets up questions in the reader s mind as to what s coming in the final volume It could be argued that Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the best of the series so far Given what has come before that is saying a lot Harry is growing up before the reader s eyes and one can t help rooting for him to prevail Regardless of what the future holds the present holds many rich wonders for readers and the hints of the possibilities to come are tantalizing more"

"140","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Apr 01 2013"," Krystal","liked it"," Well it was actually kind of fun re-reading this one because my memory of the series gets a bit foggy after 5 That being said this book is still enormously frustrating The good I really liked the memories It s quite fascinating to get glimpses of Little Tom and his evil beginnings There s a ton of new names to try and remember but it was nice to have some vastly different content for a change In terms of the change of tone the last book was almost like juvenile delinquency whereas this book is more hardened criminal The dark times are finally getting DARK and it almost kind of refreshes the series There s still plenty of magic but a lot of it is hexes and curses and even though classes are still happening we re given these flashbacks of dark times and evil people and it helps to finally bring a seriousness to the storyline that the previous books have been lacking Plus HI SNAPE D I love this guy so much he s such a great character Call me a horrible person but I greatly enjoyed his shining moment at the end there He s such a badass view spoiler Honestly I was kinda sick of Dumbledore s secrets and irresponsible behaviour so really Snape did me a huge favour hide spoiler Draco has a totally different role in this one and it bothered me how much Harry obsessed over him Poor Ron and Hermione having to listen to Harry go on and on and on about it I started to get bored reading about it that s for sure Draco seems pretty pathetic in this book sadly Not nearly the fun antagonistic trouble maker of the past I liked that he s kind of growing up though Like he s one of few who have realised that life exists beyond the school So props to him for that Also loved the Prince s spell book Like maybe that s partly because of my insider info on who the Prince is but I love that this guy scribbles his own notes What a genius Way to fight The Man man You do you The bad Dumbledore Is A Moron THERE I SAID IT This guy is pretty freaking irresponsible for a teacher He never explains anything which is incredibly frustrating and he guards all these ridiculous secrets for seemingly no reason Instead of straight up telling Harry what he needs to know he takes his time showing him all these memories and never properly explaining the purpose Plus HARRY IS A KID Why he is encouraging reckless behaviour in children is questionable But also he was going about this quest over the summer without Harry So why does he suddenly need him Like maybe even sit him down and be like look Harry I d love to be the one to get rid of Voldy but it s probably gonna have to be you So I m gonna destroy as many of these things as possible but if something bad happens to me you ll have to pick up where I left off alright But really there are a ton of teachers at the school that could easily have helped Dumbledore and I still cannot comprehend why he roped in Harry That right there is an unhealthy fixation IT MAKES NO SENSE That is my 2 issue with this whole series there is no logic to the way Dumbledore behaves My 1 issue is Harry being an arrogant jerk and still having everyone in the world love him as he wins every battle and gets everything his heart desires with very few consequences I m also curious about what the Order is actually doing during the events in this book We re not really told a lot Like it s kind of weird that this book has so much school stuff when things are getting a bit out of control The series is really bi-polar when it comes to its focus - it s got all this fun magic school stuff but then it also wants to focus on the world coming to an end It s a bizarre combination I get frustrated by how little the adults are involved especially when magic plays such a big role because obviously the adults are going to be better at magic Plus I like Remus and Tonks They are fun And of course this wouldn t be a review if I didn t moan about Harry a bit He s still arrogant He still ignores his friends He still does stupid things And now he s obsessing over Ginny which frankly weirds me out a bit Ron took it far better than I would have But he also just has this complex where he seems to think he s above everyone He rejects authority and constantly argues with teachers and his lack of respect should have earned him expulsion by now He s a total brat No matter how many times he s told to leave things alone he still goes at it like a bull in a china shop But then - and you ll notice this has been happening six books straight - he gets rewarded for it No matter how badly or how often this kid screws up he ALWAYS lands on his feet Even just things like Hermione constantly doing his homework bug me Plus I totally resent the fact that he got over Sirius so fast My heart is still in pieces over here you ungrateful sod And no matter how many times his friends save his life or help him with things he still thinks it s all about him eyeroll I can t deal with this self-centred douchebag I really admire Rowling s creativity and imagination because I love the world she s built but there is just so much flawed logic in the way this series is written I think a lot of it feels like the series kind of got away from her - like it kinda just escalated til it wasn t so kid-friendly any more but she didn t quite know how to deal with that Because when it comes down to it this is a book about kids dealing with problems that should be handled by experienced adults and there s really no decent explanation of why It s a fun enough story for sure but if you stop and think about some of the explanations there are gaping black holes where logic should be So skeptics like me will struggle a little and the kiddies are probably gonna have a rough time with the dark turn things have taken but I guess if you relax and let the story wash over you it s a rather interesting continuation of the series with some valuable insights into the past Original delayed review Ok so I m not much of a Potter fan Yes maybe I devoured the series one book immediately after the other but I just got so frustrated with how moronic and conceited Harry is throughout the ENTIRE SERIES We get it you re super special and the fate of the world is in your hands But you gotta chill out son and share the load with your friends Also think things through Like using someone else s notes was always gonna end badly Do your own dang homework you lazy sod Honestly I should re-read the entire series so I can give sassy reviews with everything fresh in my mind but I feel like my HP hate might hurt some feelings Snape is cool though okay I like him I like him a lot more than big-headed Harry more"
"141","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Nov 18 2012"," Christina","it was amazing"," And now Harry let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress adventure 5 starsSo I know I say this about pretty much every HP book but I think this one may just be my favorite despite the sadness it brings on We find out so much about Tom Riddle before he became Lord Voldemort and I loved getting those glimpses into his life from before his birth to him as a child to his path into adulthood growing darker and darker You have got to give JKR credit for the way she fleshes out all of her characters even the most hated of villains has got a backstory Did you know -- then asked Harry Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark wizard of all time said Dumbledore No I had no idea that he was to grow up to be what he is However I was certainly intrigued by him I returned to Hogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him something I should have done in any case given that he was alone and friendless but which already I felt I ought to do for others sake as much as his Despite the fact that this book is still a bit darker and has taken a turn for the serious you can also see the growth that the characters all go through as they get older and more mature in some ways and take more note of the world around them and begin to develop romantic interest in others This book covers the prophecy more and sets up the journey Harry has to undertake in the final installment so well My emotions are all over the place and this is a re-read I already know how it all goes but I love getting to feel everything over again I remember being completely wrecked after reading this for the first time and realizing how long of a wait I had before the 7th book came out Luckily I already have The Deathly Hallows waiting on me to just finish this review Don t you see Voldemort himself created his worst enemy just as tyrants everywhere do Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress All of them realize that one day amongst their many victims there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back Voldemort is no different Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him He heard the prophecy and he leapt into action with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him he handed him uniquely deadly weapons And as always so many wonderful quotes to take note of There is nothing to be feared from a body Harry any more than there is anything to be feared from the darkness It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness nothing more People find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right Killing is not nearly as easy as the innocent believe Off to my re-read of Deathly Hallows now wish me luck everyone But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him It was he thought the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high Some people perhaps would say that there was little to choose between the two ways but Dumbledore knew--and so do I thought Harry with a rush of fierce pride and so did my parents-- that there was all the difference in the world more"
"142","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Feb 26 2007"," Jake","really liked it"," The first time I read it at camp I was bored and taken aback by what I saw as worthless and superfluous backstory I openly mocked the counselors and campers who cried as a result of the famous murder I reread it this past week in anticipation of the final chapter and am embarassed to say that I came close to spilling tears on the Metro as I finished it This book is better than I remembered and the history IS significant It sets up the seventh perfectly and escalates the war and plot in ways no one could have guessed The character development is astounding and truly makes you take notice of how little you knew until this book Dumbledore and Voldemort are fleshed out to an extent we hadn t seen before and if possible makes Dumbledore even more likable He represents all that is good and loving and warm in the world and Tom Riddle is his total opposite in every way Voldemort is pure evil but he never crosses the line of becoming a caricature of the villain His torture of small children his charm of the teachers his murder of his own family his desperation to achieve immortality at the expense of innocent lives it almost overwhelms the reader to see such a character thrive in the wizarding world Furthermore Slughorn was one of the best additions to the books and his likable smarm added humor and warmth to an occasionally chilling book He wasn t loathsome like Umbridge annoying like Lockhart conflicted like Lupin He knew exactly what he wanted and had no qualms using the kids to do it and for some reason it was highly enjoyable to watch his antics unfold And of course more Ginny means more joy She s by far one of the best characters in the entire series Ginny represents strength and bravery arguably more than any other character in the series and constantly looks after those that are bullied and belittled In short she s perfect more"

"160","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Aug 17 2007"," Mark","liked it"," Although not a bad book I found this to be the weakest book in the series But that s beside the point isn t it If you re reading the whole series you can t very well skip this one The main stream running through this installment is a sloooow recounting of how Lord Voldemort came to be like his is To make room for that history lesson most of the usual crowd Hagrid Neville Luna McGonagall Remus Fred George etc have smaller parts There is a side plot for Ron dealing with teen age romance but since that boils down to the standard Ron is a useless git theme it isn t very satisfying This is also a book of lost opportunities to mature Harry In book 5 Harry had to become a leader but this book generally allows Harry to duck out of making hard choices As Quidditch captain fortunate events twice let him avoid choosing between team members In romance fortunate events lead him to a girl basically falling into his arms In school fortunate events let him slide through potions class with little effort Symptomatically in one scene where Harry needs his own blood for magic he fortunately scrapes himself just moments before Maybe I m missing the point and we are supposed to understand that Harry isn t anyone special he s just very very lucky more"

"166","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Apr 22 2018"," Sasagawa","it was amazing"," I have to say firstly that this read was great as usual I did not expect such plot twists and amazing character development Now this book had the most serious tone in the series I am yet to read the final book but for now this is the densest read in the HP series it started of serious and ended on a grim note A very grim note when someone just decides that is enough and goes rogue with a darkened heart The characters have been phenomenal and the way JK keeps adding new characters with a unique personality one can only be in awe The characters are unbelievably layered Harry in this book learnt how to control himself better and take a more authoritarian objective role without being a pansy Of course this was facilitated by his friends and Dumbledore His right hand man Ronald Weasley was too busy tonguing the living lights out of a girl for the majority of this book and assisted him little Ron of course only likes one girl but does not know how to express it As for Hermione you could say that she was actually assisting Harry as usual and finding ways to help him She too was stuck in her own bubble in this book Now Dumbledore the great headmaster he was a blast he did everything and anything to keep everyone together Always A true wizard He made Harry grow the fastest he shared with him dark secrets As for new characters I will only mention one character Profressor Slughorn He had an insipid personality A dull character he did not have anything to offer apart from unfathomable contacts and magnificent potion skills He lacked a spine get it Slughorn ok leave that - - and upright character He was just infatuated by people s skills and fame and how he could make them part of his circle of famous valuable people Here are some honorable mentions I ll start with Snape he had a lot to play in this book he was a big fish and I do not know how to feel about him still he s infuriated me and I have also felt sorry for him Is he some sort of triple agent I do not know He has irked me beyond belief and he has left me with mixed feelings For the most part I do loathe him Time for the Weasleys Ginny Weasley was a strong character and she has had some amazing development She oozes confidence and has enough gall to take Harry s place An alternate protagonist for sure She and it finally happened I shipped them from the onset and it was a surreal moment Ok no more soppy me The Weasley twins unfortunately were not around much but the instances they were it was always merry this is the same for Molly and Arthur Oh how I love the Weasleys I have to also mention how Tonks gathered herself by the end of the book she was a shambles after one of the major deaths from the previous book Tonks was a random card from Jk and she sure played her role well I m happy to see Tonks nymphy again And Fleur yes Fleur she surprised me with her perspective as she came across the type that only liked someone for their aesthetics When things changed for her good-looking partner after a vicious attack whom was left beat up and scarred Everyone expected her to be detached but she punctuated with vigor and passion What do I care how e looks I am good-looking enough for both of us I theenk All these scars show is zat my husband is brave Now that s a woman Overall folks it was a roller coaster continuous darkness and ending in further darkness I m looking forward to the final book folks and merci for reading ------------------------------------------------------------------------------Here s a Weasley-esque tradition to keep things consistent don t read this part it s just nonsensical the review is over my mother always packs me a rucksack full of food whenever I visit my sister who lives 150 miles away from us the bag contains a chicken curry a mutton curry a fish curry a stir fry and even some random foreign herbs My mother once even added a tub full of kebabs and said here take this and if you are hungry have some I was like what the fudge 0 0 mum you can t be serious I m going to stink up the whole train up Obviously my mother did not care and just waved her hand casually and kissed me bye D more"

"170","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Feb 17 2013"," Becky","it was amazing"," I remember when this book was originally released I d gotten into the Harry Potter phenomenon late after the 5th book was out and during the time before Half-Blood Prince was out I d read and re-read the first 5 books A LOT So then comes the 6th book s release and by this time I m just as rabid for it as everyone else I need to know what s happened I need to know whether Sirius but no What I really need to know is What Will Harry Do Now The day comes and at the time I was working a late shift I got out of work at 11 15pm raced to the bookstore for the midnight release and found it closed dark and the parking lot nearly empty when I got there at 11 30 OH I was LIVID I immediately literally standing in the parking lot called the bookstore and ripped the manager a new one The book releases at MIDNIGHT I HAD A PRE-ORDER You don t get to sell it early just because you don t feel like being there into the early hours of the morning I was so angry that Mr Sheepishly Apologetic Bookstore Manager even offered to reopen the store for me I refused on principle What He made me mad and I just wanted him to know it Though honestly if I was really feeling vindictive I should have made him re-openThe summumabeech What does this story have to do with anything Nothing much except to establish my almost desperate frame of mind I NEEDED that book But I knew they d be available everywhere That night there were so many copies of Half-Blood Prince around that I could practically have snagged one off of a passing owl And just as an aside I ll tell you that when the 7th book came out a couple years later that bookstore was open and selling them properly I take personal credit Not that I was there I went to a different store again on principle Because I hold grudges like that Anyway with my new acquisition I raced home told my boyfriend he had to go out with his friends so that he didn t disturb me and I devoured the book in hours And it was like a cool drink of water after you ve been thirsty for a long time I HAD A NEW HARRY POTTER BOOK But after finishing I was like Eh it s just a filler bridge to the last book book I wasn t disappointed - don t get me wrong I had loved it But I am admitting that it took me a couple reads to really REALLY appreciate it properly All the things that we learn all the ways that this book brings all the things that we d seen in the first 5 books together how Harry finally realizes what it all means and what he ll have to do how he can t just hope to keep defending himself and those he loves but knows he ll need to go on the offensive if he hopes to win It was all amazing brilliantly woven together into this awesome next-to-last book When Harry tells Ron and Hermione about the real prophecy and he is grateful to them for not shrinking away from him as though he d suddenly turned leprous it hits home just how alone Harry truly is I never expected them to do differently but Harry feared they might It shows how much of a complex Harry has about his role in everything - he s always been alone separate so it surprises him that his friends would stick by him And even at the very end he is again surprised when they refuse to let him shrug them off and take the Horcrux Hunt onto his own shoulders completely Harry Harry You have better friends than you can possibly know What I wouldn t give for friends that would stand with me like that time after time after time and in the face of such danger and fear Silly boy I also love Snape in this book He s as much of a jerk as always but in the chapter where he s running from Hogwarts when he screams at Harry not to call him a coward how his voice is described how he s STILL trying to teach Harry but Harry is too full of blind rage to hear to think to learn It s brilliant Harry reaches his conclusions and refuses to see any other alternative despite what Dumbledore has exemplified year after year - openmindedness trust understanding Damn I love this book Just amazing more"

"248","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Dec 28 2013"," Always Reading","it was amazing"," Inhalt Seit Voldemort der gef hrlichste schwarze Magier aller Zeiten zur ckgekehrt ist herrschen Aufruhr und Gewalt in der magischen Welt Als Harry Potter und seine Freunde Ron und Hermine zu ihrem sechsten Schuljahr nach Hogwarts kommen gelten strengste Sicherheitsma nahmen in der Zauberschule Dumbledore will seine Sch tzlinge vor dem Zugriff des B sen bewahren Um Harry zu wappnen erforscht er mit ihm die Geschichte des Dunklen Lords Ob auch Harrys Zaubertrankbuch das fr her einem Halbblutprinzen geh rte ihm helfen kann Nur ein Detail fehlt das Harry finden muss dann liegt das Geheimnis um Voldemort offen Dumbledore f hrt ihn doch im alles entscheidenden Moment ist der Halbblutprinz zur Stelle und zeigt sein wahres Gesicht Wieder einmal begreift Lord Voldemort nicht dass es viel schrecklichere Dinge gint als k rperliche Verletzunge - Albus Dumbledore S 564Meine MeinungDiesmal f ngt die Geschichte etwas anders an Harry Potter und der Halbblutprinz beginnt mit einem Gespr ch zwischen dem Premierminister und dem Zaubereiminister in dem der Sommer der zwischen den B chern liegt zusammengefasst wird Ich empfinde das als interessantes Mittel um zu verdeutlichen dass die Lage nun immer ernster wird Au erdem bemerkt der Leser dass die Zusammenarbeit beider Welten eher auf einem Pflichtgef hl basiert und widerwillig passiert Kurz darauf geht es dann auch gleich mit Dumbledore los der auf seine eigene Art die Dursleys erstmal richtig sch n zur Sau macht um anschlie end Harry auszunutzen Das macht er ja immer deswegen ist man daran schon gew hnt und man m chte Harry am liebsten schlagen weil er das stillschweigend hinnimmt und sich damit abfindet Sobald man im Fuchsbau ist entsteht eine vollkommen andere Stimmung die irgendwie fr hlicher ist trotz des bedrohlichen Untertons der ja schon seit dem Vorg nger in der Geschichte zu finden ist J K Rowling streut immer wieder Nebens tze oder Kleinigkeiten ein damit man immer wieder daran erinnert wird dass die Lage ernst ist und man kurz vorm Krieg steht Egal in welchem Setting man sich befindet das komplette Buch hat irgendwie einen Touch Jugendbuch Nicht dass das schlimm w re es f llt mir in diesem Teil nur immer besonders auf Die Charaktere sind nun endg ltig in der Pubert t angekommen und zwar alle von ihnen Irgendwie ist das aber ganz lustig weil sie stellenweise voll unwichtige Sachen aufbauschen obwohl die echt andere viel gr ere Probleme haben Vor allem Ron ist in diesem Band die Zicke vom Dienst Gott ist das ne Dramaqueen In diesem Punkt finde ich es gut dass weder Harry noch Hermine sich das Gefallen lassen und ihn immer wieder auf den Boden der Tatsachen zur ckholen anstatt sich stillschweigend anp beln zu lassen Die Beiden sind zwar auch nicht ohne aber anscheinend darf nur jeweils einer pro Buch so drauf sein Allgemein spielt die Freundschaft der drei wieder eine sehr gro e Rolle und scheint noch mehr Szenen zu beherrschen als vorher Wer es bis jetzt noch nicht geschnallt hat wird sp testens jetzt bemerken dass es darauf hinausl uft dass die drei zusammen die gef hrlichsten und schwersten Schritte gehen werden Ebenfalls ein sehr gro es Thema ist der Schulalltag Es kommt mir so vor als w re er wieder mehr Bestandteil der Handlung als im vorherigen Band Die ganze Sache mit dem Buch des Halbblutprinzen f hrt dann zu einigem R tselraten und wenn Harry und Hermine sich wegen des Buches anzicken wie Geschwister f hrt das auch zu dem einen oder anderem Lacher Auch wenn es mir sehr schwerf llt zu glauben dass man wegen eines Buches gleich Klassenbester wird Kann ja sein dass es hilft aber sollte man nicht dennoch ein Talent in dem Bereich haben Ja Harry war jetzt nicht die Dummbratze vom Dienst und die schlechten Noten in dem Fach lagen ja gr tenteils an Snape und stellenweise an Harrys Faulheit Aber dass er auf einmal der Mords berflieger ist Bessere Note ja okay aber das absolute Genie in einem Fach f r das er sich sonst einen feuchten Furz interessiert hat Ich wei ja nicht Eine Sache die mir aber wirklich gegen den Strich ging war die Sache mit Malfoy Ja Harry hat sich in der Vergangenheit in seinen Hass gegen ber Personen hineingesteigert Aber in allen vorherigen B chern wurde immer wieder bewiesen dass er in vielen Vermutungen richtig liegt und die Vergangenheit hat gezeigt dass er recht hat und einen Riecher daf r hat etwas zu erkennen was irgendwie verd chtig aussieht oder hnliches Das gesamte vorherige Buch handelte davon dass er Recht hat Wieso nimmt ihn niemand allen voran seinen besten Freunden ernst Was soll der Schei Gib f nf Harry Ich wei wie es dir geht Auf mich h rt auch nie jemand obwohl meine Erfolgsquote in den letzten drei Jahren bei 100 liegt In Harry Potter und der Halbblutprinz wird endlich auch mal Voldemorts Vergangenheit beleuchtet und die finde ich echt interessant Was mir so gut gef llt Dass er einfach mal b se ist Ja gut er hat s nicht einfach gehabt aber es kommt mal nicht der ganze ausgelutschte Kram von wegen traurige Kindheit Er ist so wie er ist weil er auf der einen Seite sich f r eine Richtung entschieden hat und weil er von Natur aus einfach b se ist Man darf nicht vergessen dass er nicht auf herk mmlichen Wege gezeugt wurde Mir gef llt das richtig gut dass wir hier keine verkr ppelte Seele und eine ach so traurige Vergangenheit haben Er ist B se Punkt Aus Ende Das Ende ist dann berraschend und enorm wichtig f r die nachfolgende Handlung Der ganze Aufbau dieser Szene hat mir unheimlich gut gefallen und auch die darauffolgenden Auswirkungen das hat J K Rowling mal wieder bewiesen was sie drauf hat Die letzten Seiten legen dann den Grundstein f r die Handlung des letzten Buches und machen mehr als Lust auf den n chsten und letzten Teil Fazit Gut besser Harry Potter Auch Harry Potter und der Halbblutprinz macht Spa Die Handlung kommt voran es wird immer mehr enth llt und man reimt sich alles sch n w hrend des Lesens zusammen Die Protagonisten sind nicht fehlerfrei aber das macht sie greifbarer und realistischer Man hat sofort Lust auf den letzten Teil und genau das mache ich jetzt auch 5 5 Sternen more"

"250","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Jul 19 2008"," Ashley","it was amazing"," In the summer of 2003 the Arizona Diamondbacks went on a crazy intense winning streak due mostly to the fact that they had something like eleven to thirteen rookies playing at any given time all of whom were unknown quantities and thus harder to beat They were calling them the Baby Backs future Cy Young winner Brandon Webb among them As of June 30 2003 the team had won eleven consecutive games one away from beating their record My sister Melissa likes baseball in an unnatural obsessive fashion much the way I like TV and got us tickets to the game Naturally this concerned me due to the midnight release part of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix which I was supposed to be attending that night Bear with me this story does eventually relate to Half-Blood Prince So it s like the bottom of the 8th inning and we re losing and I m really worried at this point that we re going to be late so I make my entire family get up and leave My sister put up a little bit of a fight but as we were losing by at least three runs she eventually shut up and we left But as we were walking back to the car the stadium EXPLODED And kept exploding Fireworks went off not a euphemism And my sister turned to me and knifed my bowels into ribbons with just the power of her angry eyes I tried to explain to her that you don t fuck around with Harry Potter but not five minutes later when we d reached the car and turned on the radio and she learned that we d won that 12th consecutive game and that we d been there and left I really thought she might murder me She hadn t read Harry Potter yet you see She didn t understand Fast forward two years She was right there with me at the midnight release of Half-Blood Prince dressed as Draco Malfoy We raced home together and read the book late into the night waking up early to finish I finished first and she was mad when I started crying and she had to wait to find out why And of course later in the shower when I remembered what happened and started crying AGAIN is there anything more pathetic than crying in the shower over a dead fictional character after I got out she couldn t resist making fun of me Apparently I d been crying so loud that she d heard the sobs through the walls and over the sound of the running water But FUCK man That shit is sad Served her right ten minutes later when it was her turn to cry But anyway the point is that none of you should be in doubt Harry Potter is way more important than baseball And football And soccer And Hockey And that is a lesson everybody should learn more"

"252","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Jul 27 2015"," Rebecca whymermaids","it was amazing"," Half-Blood Prince makes me cry bit fat hot tears for like three entire chapters it grabs me emotionally and wrings me with so much hurt an ominous sign for Deathly Hallows which I avoid reading watching because of the emotional wreckage It s painful and beautiful and tragic I was never a fan of the romance angle of HBP and the Penseive Dance while really interesting is basically the main plot and drama of the story which kind of falls flat in comparison to the Triwizard Tournament and the growing darkness and hostility of Order of the Phoenix While the adventure with Dumbledore at the end is exciting and intriguing and the Battle is terrifying and heart-pounding I don t think it lives up to the previous books Not that it isn t interesting and the end isn t heartbreaking but overall the plot falls a little flat for me Mind you my eyes are still red and puffy from all the crying Let it be said however and despite my personal feelings about the pairing book Ginny Weasley is so much better than movie Ginny She has spunk and is a nice counter to Hermione s intellect and brains-first attitude Ginny is popular and pretty and dates around and doesn t let her brothers give her crap for it And there s something to be said of that She holds her own with Harry and his friends and with Fred and George when she needs to and that s so much cooler than the movie Ginny who has no personality That being said I m not a Harry-Ginny fan To me it feels rushed look at the Ron-Hermione 7 book long setup and Ginny seems to be too much of a replacement for his mother He doesn t notice her for years and then all of a sudden his monster is upset she s kissing Dean I just don t buy it I also feel like Harry needs someone outside the realm of his group of friends if anyone at all Why does Harry need a girlfriend He will never be happy at home and while I get that part of the Ginny relationship works because she s okay with him off battling battles because that s what he does it just never felt right to me HBP also has the ultimate betrayal or does it and I remember being SO ANGRY and confused WHY One of my least favorites of the series but it still has some really great moments Felix Felicis and is ultimately still Harry Potter I m starting Deathly Hallows with a box of tissues next to me more"

"278","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Jul 14 2017"," Bubu","it was amazing"," Hooookay this was actually the audio book that I ve been listening to in the past three days and my favourite of the series I m still bashing my head against my desk Oh well moving on This series was the first one I bought when I became an audible member back in February It was more out of sentimentality rather than willingness to listen to them Having re-read the series multiple times and being completely new to audio books I was a little wary of how I d conceive the story told by another person Every book creates a new world differently from one reader to another May it be the voices the situations the looks And I wasn t sure at all So this review will be more about the narration rather than the book itself Those who have read the book will know the plot those who have seen the film will know at least parts of the plot All I ll say is that Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince covers a magnificent range of human emotion darkness fun sadness hilarity vindictiveness anger hormonal teenagers and first heart break mundane emotions such as conceit that lead to tragic events Actually it emphasises how every day feelings - that we all carry with us - can lead to tragic events and how history repeats itself Maybe not necessarily in the same person But if one has seen it in someone else one may think twice But no human nature is flawed and we will make the same mistakes over and over again And Stephen Fry s narration captures all these feelings and nuances beautifully How to describe it I had quite a busy day starting very early And after hesitating to listen to this series with Stephen Fry for months I decided to give it a shot I still had to get ready but the moment I heard his voice I actually sat down and just listened for a full 30 minutes and almost getting late Admittedly I am no expert in audio books but I ve listened to a few now though most of them still not rated here but it was the first time that I actually sat down and simply listened Nothing else When one knows the book inside out it s rather difficult I suppose to find something new or different How wrong I was Fry takes his time no word or sentence feels rushed the intonation nigh perfect evoking each character each situation to its full potential I didn t feel as if my own world that I d created so many years ago was violated or distorted but rather enriched and complemented Also and this weirded me out a little I found myself laughing at scenes that I know I didn t laugh before Not because they weren t amusing moments but Fry s narration gave the situation just that little bit more I don t know what Stephen Fry s other audio books are like I ll find out eventually I guess having bought the Sherlock Homes edition But despite their price tags despite having the hardcover paperback and kindle versions of the series I m not strange at all I couldn t be happier about my decision to buy the audio books more"
"279","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Feb 18 2015"," Jonathan Terrington","really liked it"," These books continue to get better and better as they go along It might surprise some reading this that I was tempted to give this book five stars for pure enjoyment but objectively I do not believe it was quite as good as many other five star novels The story in this novel should be familiar to anyone with any knowledge of popular culture that of Harry Potter the boy wizard who must fight and defeat the dark lord Voldemort Indeed there has been an entire subculture of pop culture akin to other franchises like Marvel DC Game of Thrones Doctor Who etc which has developed alongside these books and initially made me very skeptical of the series I was particularly skeptical with the first three books the third book improved on the first two admittedly with the poorly defined magic systems the childish characters the writing that was still quite rough-around-the-edges and actually only was attracted to the worldbuilding and the overall charm of the novels However as Rowling has continued to write her quality of plotting character-development and worldbuilding has also improved In short her novels have transformed into typical children s fiction and become something more worthwhile Let me explain why these books become more worthwhile For instance the first few novels were so singularly focused on the schooling at Hogwarts that any reference to the overall villains seemed like some cheap side-story However this novel and the previous two adopt more mature tones and a clearer focus on where the entire story is headed The novels also reveal heightened levels of political subtext and references to how education systems and government systems are run forming a kind of fascinating analysis of real life despite featuring a magical world - something more fantasy books should undertake Character building further improves These books are perhaps the most famous coming-of-age stories in the world at the moment and they are with the overall character development prime examples of this Harry though involved in helping the adult world must deal with the pressures of being treated like a child - albeit a special child - and these later novels expose these pressures with writing full of emotion charm and greater wit It s somewhat manipulative of Rowling but her novels are written in a way that the expected audience can grow alongside the characters and find that they themselves can identify strongly with what the characters feel Children and teenagers certainly understand what it is to feel special powerless weak inadequate intelligent and awkward These are emotions that Rowling exposes and uses in useful ways as a writer Admittedly as fantasy books these are far from the greatest examples They are nice children s novels - although I place far greater importance on The Chronicles of Narnia Alice in Wonderland The Hobbit and gems like Little House in the Woods or Little Women And this importance is only because those were novels which defined part of my childhood reading experience add in some Roald Dahl or other classics of course I almost forgot to mention the prose itself It s a nice charming style which Rowling has fine-tuned by the time of this book casual enough simple but with nuance and sophistication hidden in the word-choices it s certainly a very sympathetic type of writing and one suitable for her audience I would state that the best and most recognizable technique of Rowling s is her use of foreshadowing and asides together Some of her foreshadowing is very neat and clever and though some of it in the earlier books is very obvious by the stage of this book it is reached a stage where it becomes more intriguing rather than apparent As for the plot of this book well it focuses on the terror that the return of Voldemort has brought to the wizarding world and the discovery of an important textbook owned by a mysterious Half-Blood Prince a textbook which provides all kinds of secret tips for Harry in his potions class The interesting Snape and the fatherly Dumbledore have greater roles again in this novel and the resolution leads to something of a cliff-hanger but not quite In short it s an interesting novel where the devil is in the details as they say To me I think that a lot of the reputation of these novels is undeserved They are nice books and certainly enjoyable much like Hunger Games or Divergent is to me and I appreciate that they lead a lot of children into the greater world of reading I also feel that the whole evil books side of the reputation with some parents not allowing their children to read them is also undeserved There are some great themes and lessons in here - although I dislike the harsh punishments handed out by teachers and the casual use of hexes and curses in the books at times The biggest draw is of course the wizarding world and the idea of having a school for wizards which I don t think is something seen in western literature in this way Either way I certainly am enjoying reading these books like I enjoy the other books They re mostly unique charming and get better as they continue more"

"284","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Sep 11 2014"," Tiff at Mostly YA Lit","really liked it"," 4 stars Second read Spoilers EVERYWHERE Unlike the other mega-large Harry Potter books aka 4 5 and 7 I ended up liking Half-Blood Prince a little less the second time around The full-steam-ahead feeling that characterized Books 4 and 5 seemed to lose a little bit of momentum here If Order of the Phoenix is the book where things get real in the Harry Potter world then Half-Blood Prince is a quieter book the moment when Rowling is really planning for the ending building the story and background for the last part of the story and the inevitable battle between Voldemort and Harry On my first read of Half-Blood Prince I was enthralled by the backstory Finally after years we were getting to the heart of Voldemort and how he became the way he is Only by understanding him could Harry beat him On my second read though I felt like the book dragged a bit - Voldemort doesn t even really play a role in the battle at the end - and even though the actions that happen in this book are necessary to get us to book 7 it really didn t feel like a big payoff in the end I was desperate to get to certain moments in the book the second time around - I wanted Harry to get the damn memory from Slughorn immediately I wanted to get to the moment where Harry and Dumbledore discuss choices I wanted to see the cave again and even though it hurt I wanted to re-read that moment when Snape kills Dumbledore Because there were so many important bits of backstory and a lot of them occur at the end of the book my second read was characterized by a bit more impatience especially with the Malfoy subplot which I found to be a bit of a retread of book 5 in that Harry believes something that no one else does What IS interesting is how much more pronounced that obsession with catching Malfoy was to me on this second read I feel like that obsession is a bit of a foreshadowing for Harry s obsession with the Deathly Hallows in book seven and also shows Harry s stubborn belief in his own ideas without basis and the way he rushes into action also characterized by his disastrous attempts at Occlumency and his constant dreams about the Department of Mysteries in book 5 While it s good to stand up for your beliefs I think the stubbornness makes Harry reckless a lot like Sirius and it makes Harry s choices of Hallows vs Horcruxes that much smarter in book 7 Harry continues to be a very angsty teenager - with good reason but nevertheless there s a lot of anger and resentment at his predicament This was the first time in reading where I felt like I wouldn t necessarily want to be Harry s friend - he s a bit scary in his anger That said I still very much enjoyed seeing the advanced magic in Harry Ron and Hermione s NEWT classes the Quidditch games and yes the romance Half-Blood Prince is definitely the book of teenage hormones where Ron finally realizes that girls exist and thus spends quite a lot of time making out with Lavender Brown before realizing that he might actually like someone else a bit more Meanwhile Harry s realization that Ginny exists as a girl and not just his best friend s sister was so satisfying even the second time around Because Ginny is my favourite character I was grateful that we got so much more of her in this book and got to see how unlike Harry s relationship with Cho which was really based on her looks Harry and Ginny already had a rapport they ve known each other for a long time and his feelings grew naturally out of his gradual knowledge of her as a smart funny talented and headstrong girl who isn t afraid to fight back Even the scenes when they re together are so different from Harry s date with Cho where he was stuck in Madam Puddifoot s - right after Harry and Ginny get together they re sitting casually in the Gryffindor common room laughing with Ron and Hermione It s clear that this is a relationship that is real It s not a perfect read but nevertheless the second time around the scenes at the end of the book with Harry and Dumbledore still made me cry I knew the first time around that Dumbledore would have to die - there s a reason why that cliche about the old mentor dying before the hero can move on exists - but even knowing all that did not stop me from feeling the poignancy of the funeral of Harry and Ginny s break-up and the moment when Hermione and Ron step up and insist on going with Harry on his mission more"

"286","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Jan 02 2016"," Lucinda Taylor","it was amazing"," Since you re all sleeping on this amazing book let me remind you of the great things that happen here - Draco Malfoy is a proper protagonist and his character development is the best of the entire series - We meet Horace Slughorn aka one the pillars of the Wizarding World along with Gilderoy Lockhart of course - Fudge is out of the way - Bellatrix and Snape have a face-off filled with more drama than a PLL episode - Ginny is full of sass - Fleur is as well - And let s not forget Harry s There s no need to call me sir Professor - Voldemort s past story is revealed - Snape becomes an interesting character - Dumbledore the Fake Bitch finally dies - Drarry begins to rise - Harry formulates the first true theory ever - The best quote of the whole series is in this book aka It was he thought the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high Some people perhaps would say that there was little to choose between the two ways but Dumbledore knew and so do I thought Harry with a rush of fierce pride and so did my parents that there was all the difference in the world - Many many other beautiful things This book is great not to mention my favorite in the entire series so stop hating on it Proper review to come once I reread the series in a coherent way Until then peace out more"

"288","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Apr 13 2015"," Roberta Jayne","really liked it"," 4 5 stars While the quality of the Harry Potter books are without a doubt consistently brilliant This book is definitely not my favourite in the series I think this is mostly due to the bunch of annoying characters that suddenly spring up in this book Cormac McLaggen Lavender Brown and Horace Slughorn to name a few particularly bugged me But honestly Slughorn was by far the worst I just cannot find any reason to like him as a person and seeing as he s only introduced into the story to provide background information on Voldemort and to keep Harry entertained during the year while Dumbledore is off doing more important things I don t see why I should care about him at all Ginny however was fantastic I love how strong her character became in this book and I thought it was cute to see Harry start to think of her as her own person and not just Ron s sister Harry and Ginny Awh And of course Dumbledore s death was bloody heartbreaking I m incredibly excited to reach the end of this series soon because I ve just enjoyed these books so much more"
"289","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"," Jul 01 2014"," Sara","it was amazing"," I wish I was writing this review before having already read book number 7 Just to be able to remember the feelings the book made me have for Snape but I m not saying anything more just in case you re among the few lucky that still have a Harry Potter left to read for the first time However my general mood about this book has not changed through the years I feel book number 6 is a very long introduction to the epilogue of the saga in book number 7 It doesn t have the tension of neither book 5 7 or 4 The best parts are the beginning and the end i e the parts that don t take place at Hogwarts or that are not related to school in the more general sense of the term That being said this is still a Harry Potter and even if it is not one of my favorites it s still a world class book Glad you won t experience the pang of disappointment at the end of it because you feel you needed more as lucky you book 7 is already out there and you ll not have to wait a whole year or two as I had to back then more"
