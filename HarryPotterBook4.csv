"6","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Aug 25 2009"," Stephen","it was amazing"," This was the beginning of my addiction to POTter I had previously experimented with and enjoyed POTter on 3 different occasions but could easily have walked away and never touched the stuff again Then under some pressure from some POTterHEAD peers of mine I tried the newest blend called the Goblet and everything changed As the warm easy potato chip prose crossed my blood-brain barrier euphoria ensued My inner child was smitten I was hooked and I was happy Ignore the so-called experts who say POTter is brain cell killing pap Don t listen to those jaded book snobby squares Most of them are wound so tight they wouldn t know a good book if it sat on their face and wriggled POTter makes you feel good POTter makes you smile POTter makes you joyous and giggly Hell POTter makes you want to use the word giggly POTter is enjoyable and fun That s enough for me So what made the Goblet so much more addicting than the rest of the POTter I had tried Part of it was that I had already seen the movies up through Order of the Phoenix before I got my hands on genuine POTter The first 3 were fun but I felt like I had already been there done that as they were pretty faithfully adaptated for the screen Still enjoyable but not enough to put the POTter monkey on my back Then came the Goblet of POTter and it was a big huge tightly-rolled fatty at 750 pages The cut diluted movie strain couldn t hope to be as potent as the primo original and the story was finally given the room to breathe and take on an epic feel It was completely addictive The world-building details started coming fast and furious and the characters were given considerably increased depth Add that to Rowling s breezy ear friendly prose and I found myself spaced out for hours turning the pages and still hungering for more It s high praise indeed when I say that 750 pages did not contain a single dull ploddy moment This was fun and wonderful and a pleasure to experience It deserves to be recognized for the iconic work that it is in the realm of YA fantasy Is it popcorn Certainly Is it a joy to read Definitely Is it one I HIGHLY RECOMMEND to all lovers of feel good comfort food YES 5 0 stars Winner Hugo Award for Best Science Fiction Novel 2001 Nominee Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel 2001 Nominee Bram Stoker Award YA for Best Novel 2001 more"

"10","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Jan 02 2011"," Adam Silvera","it was amazing"," Reread done for AdamRereadsHP GOBLET OF FIRE is definitely work and I could ve done for a lot of cutting One of the things I admire most about this series is the way J K Rowling can speed through a year in under 300 pages And GOBLET is twice that length and it didn t always feel justified I shouldn t complain because more time in this world is MORE TIME IN THIS WORLD and it s all very realized but the pacing still felt off I really really could ve done without the Quidditch World Cup When I first read this novel when I was 13 going on 14 I took a break for MONTHS And the same thing happened during this reread as a 28-year-old I think it was around the same part too But once you get to the Third Task it all picks up This last fourth of the novel has always been my favorite Voldemort s return That scene with the Death Eaters Harry vs Voldemort Moody isn t Moody Rita Skeeter exposed It s all wonderful GOBLET isn t my favorite in the series but it s still pretty damn magical more"

"25","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Jun 13 2015"," P","it was amazing"," It is my belief that the truth is generally preferable to lies Re-read - Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire steps up from the previous ones very well it s the darkest book I ve ever read since Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone Who knows Harry Potter grows up and becomes a boy who has to take the responsibility on his shoulders he never wants to be selected he never wants glory and prestige yet the world turns against him anyway I love that this book isn t a children s book anymore in my opinion it becomes hastily intense and has more dimensions than J K Rowling had ever intended She did a great job when she wrote this book I could see her intention for the book to be a mature one and she made the right decision for doing that I m so pround of her and so she becomes my favorire author EVER If you want to know what a man s like take a good look at how he treats his inferiors not his equals It matters not what someone is born but what they grow to be Not only this book is full of adventures but it hides some messages for you to discover Isn t it the best way to teach our children via books Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire has everything I ve asked for since the first time I read Until now the book is like a gem and I think of it as my treasure because it s so precious my eyes hurt to look at Many things happen in this book such as a tragedy and deprecation but it s the way our lives go on right So I embraced this book like a teddy bear and told myself that perhaps something really bad would happen but it s just mishaps and it would pass like a rainy day Remember if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy remember what happened to a boy who was good and kind and brave because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort Remember Cedric Diggory TeamKrumioneMore at http goo gl kNcx2n more"

"37","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Sep 01 2007"," Susan","it was amazing"," Now THAT S a book The groove that J K Rowling starts to find in HP 3 is fully realized in 4 Partly it s that the kids and therefore the readers are getting older so she can delve into more adult complex themes and situations and partly it s that I think she s really finding her voice We finally got our very own HP s I am happy to report and it s so funny to look at them all side by side b c of the HUGE leap in size between 3 and 4 Then they get a little tricky b c while 4 and 5 look to be about the same length the font in Order of the Phoenix is much smaller hence a longer book I just started that one and it honestly feels longer already More of a book book and less of a fun afternoon s diversion But I like these books as they get both darker and longer But to focus on Goblet of Fire specifically for a moment again not that I think I can bring anything new to the table in discussing these books Nevertheless I ll throw a few ideas out there just for your reading pleasure One thing that struck me as I mentioned before was the increasing maturity and complexity of situations and themes Clearly having someone die is a huge deal and I found that whole series of events really moving this time around I may have last time as well but I don t remember In a way though some of the more complex issues feel jarring next to the goofy concepts she originally created Calling non-magical people Muggles for instance It s just a stupid word and yes it sounds funny and makes kids laugh but sometimes it s hard to take all these people seriously Mud-bloods on the other hand is vicious and definitely drives the point home I just wonder if she was to do it over again if some of those terms or ideas would change a bit Yes we d all like to revisit what we did wrote when we were less sure of ourselves and our voices and ideas but of course we can t and neither can she And what do I know She claims she always knew what would happen to Harry so maybe for her Muggle is the ideal word Since as usual I find it impossible to discuss the books without referencing the films let me just say that although I hated Dobby in the movie 2 and was glad to see him mostly cut from subsequent screen incarnations I really loved him in this one The dialogue is actually quite funny and Hermione s whole S P E W thing just cracks me up Yes I know a lot of people hate it and find it annoying and whatever but I love it Of course she would have a cause like that That s who she is And poor Winky They re weird creatures and OH how I love Kreacher in the next one and I can t decide whether I am with Hermione or everyone else on their plight Either way I like that they exist they provide a bit of moral ambiguity in a world that is mostly cleanly divided between good and evil You might wonder about people but for the most part they end up squarely one or the other Other than Snape - another great piece of moral ambiguity whose complexity grows from book to book I also continue to marvel at Rowling s ability to write about the teenage mind Ron and Harry s fight is spot on as are Hermione s various reactions to it And oh these poor boys having to ask the girls to the feast I wish I had known when I was in middle school how truly hard it was for boys to talk to girls like that Although I probably wouldn t have cared being the good self-involved teenger that I was I still want to go to Hogwarts more"

"42","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Oct 27 2010"," Katya","it was ok"," Here be warned This review contains cursing Greetings loved ones and let us talk of a young witch named Hermione Granger Hermione is and always has been a delight to read Not necessarily because she s a girl but because she is the only character amongst those 14 year olds who actually has a good head on her shoulders When I was young and gullible I hated this book Hated how it killed off Cedric and how bloody the series got afterwards I hated it enough to renounce the franchize Now that I re-read it I still hate it but for all different reasons Cedric on second reading is as dull as toast so I guess the movie casting must have been really spot-on Harry has finally started to shed his unnatural maturity and has turned just as obnoxious as most boys at 13 Ron is a wanker So it s beyond me why Hermione hasn t stolen the spotlight here as she is easily the most relatable character of them all Let s look at her character - she is from a muggle family but through hard work she has become the best student in the school She studies hard follows the rules but makes exceptions when the circumstances are right She comes off as stuck-up at first but looks after her friends She keeps her promises even though she barely has time to take care of herself And yet Ron is Harry s best friend not her Why Harry and Ron are much closer than Harry and Hermione In the previous book Hermione was at odds with the boys not one but twice and that put a serious hinge on their friendship Even so that doesn t nearly come close to the drama that follows Harry and Ron s falling out in this book And then when they do make up Hermione is once again pushed back as a tercery best friend even though she sacrificed her efforts and sleep in order to help Harry learn a spell that would save his skinny ass Hermione is defined by her intelligence It falls squarely on her shoulders to help the guys when they re in a pickle - whenever they discover that rushing at an obstackle headfirst isn t going to cut it they turn to her for advice and she s also acutely aware of issues of inequality In this book she actually starts an organisation to help house elves She stands up for Hagrid when Rita Skeeter takes a sling at him and she kept Lupin s secret for months in book three simply because she believed he was a good guy And where do her efforts to promote equality lead to They re used for comedic relief It s equally disgusting how little the boys seem to appreciate her Not only do they refuse to take her seriously they consider she s for granted I mean sure Harry has lived with his relatives as an upper middle class brat a much abused middle class brat but Hermione s parents are dentists and yet she has a better awareness of social issues than he does Is Rowling trying to suggest that young activism is only for women because only women seem aware of these issues But that s not even the worst this book gets On the Yule Ball Harry and Ron take ages before they realize Hermione is a girl and thus qualified to be a dance partner obiously they can t go with each other altough it would be most logical what with all the sparks flying among them Hermione though refuses to be taken for granted She knows she deserves better than to be a go-to girl and she does - she gets to be Viktor Krum s date and she damn well got someone who appreciates her But are her friends happy for her No they re shocked and in Ron s case offended that she dared gasp make plans without them Ron goes as far as to make a scene - in which he not for the first time makes Hermione cry This was supposed to establish some beginnings of the love between Hermione and Ron but quite frankly it just makes Ron look like a wanker After Rita Skeeter s article Hermione becomes the target for bullying which in some cases turns rather dangerous Grown-up witches send her hate mail packed with all sorts of deadly stuff one of which makes the skin of her hands fall off Ron s commentary She should have seen it coming messing around with the paparazzi like that I bet the bumrag was happy she got punished for liking Krum But that s not even what s most disturbing about this thing - it s that witches who have never even met Hermione before are willing to take Skeeter s word for it even if the woman s as trustworthy as a snake Even Mrs Weasley whose own husband got blackened twice in The Daily Prophet believes her Nice message for female solidarity Ms Rowling real subtle Again I ask why can t Hermione be the hero of these series I don t think I m alone in thinking it could be so much better more"

"57","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Nov 22 2008"," Jason Koivu","really liked it"," If the shit got real in the last book well in this fourth book shit got unreal Goblet of Fire took the series forward and yet in tone it felt like a regression to the first two books Certainly it is darker and slightly more mature in subject matter However there s a lingering freshman feel which I blame on the inclusion of the Tri Wizard Tournament It seemed out of place at this point in the story I have no problem with the idea that the wizarding establishment didn t believe or want to believe that Voldemort was back and ergo they would naturally carry on with their lives as would the students so the big sporting event is not precisely my issue It s the amount of time spent on the event I m taking to task As readers we know the ultimate evil has come again so it s hard to suspend our dread and enjoy the fun and games of the tournament or at least it was hard for me Others I ve spoke to don t seem to mind the fun and games aspect of this book However to me it seemed like Rowling hadn t given the storyline maturation its due Was this a lack of skill on her part Mishandling of story pacing is just as important as plot realistic characters appropriate dialogue and knowing how to put one word after another in the correct order Perhaps the let them eat cake atmosphere of tragedy veiled is just what was called for Time and again history proves this scenario holds true for some I wasn t buying it though Rating 3 5 - Goblet gets perhaps a higher rating from me than you d think after reading that complainypants review but the fact is the book is still entertaining and at this point I was so very wrapped up in the series that Rowling could ve taken a dump published it and I would ve given it at least two stars more"
"58","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Mar 05 2017"," eKa","it was amazing"," Though it may seem too long that I finish this book it doesn t mean I didn t enjoy my reading experience It s just I was so busy with my other things Well to be honest I didn t really like the first part yes the Quidditch Tournament and I don t know why exactly That s why the 4th movie is also my less favorite so far sorry Apart from that it was a great book So great that I didn t remember the plot twist at all And when I got to that part I was like Seriously How Come This wasn t how I remember the movie But then Oh yeah that s true My bad stupid memory Rowling you re so awesome and unpredictable So that s all my review for this book And OMG I m 12 books behind schedule Will I be able to catch up HELP So many things I wanna do And on top of that So Little Time So Much To Read ain t it right everyone more"
"59","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Feb 20 2012"," Natalie Monroe","it was amazing"," Part of the reason I love Harry Potter is that it never skimps on the non-plot-related world-building Exploding Snap butterbeer Qudditch World cup My goodness Rowling Do you have a direct hotline to the Nine Muses If so can I have their number too I leave you with this gifset Expecto patronum bitches"

"61","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Sep 16 2016"," Adita The Slumbering Insomniac","it was amazing"," Using stars lavishly because hey it s Harry Potter SPOILER ALERT I always thought that I was the last person on Earth to read Harry Potter turns out to my great relief that there are many good people who are still waiting in the line I would normally never care to attach spoiler alert with Harry Potter what s there to spoil but statistics tell otherwise So I don t want people flinging their shoes at me least of all an Imperius or Cruciatus curse This book will always be the most favorite one for me for many reasons the most important reason being Cedric Diggory Unlike other books this one gave us someone else too to dote on other than the indefatigable trio- Harry Hermione and Ron THE TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT Any year that exempts Harry from taking the year-end exams has got to be the best one even though he was granted the concession only in the light of other scarier tasks This is the year when the rivalry between houses has a slightly subdued presence as the Beauxbatons and the Durmstrang crowd arrives In the face of stiff international competition the rare display of camaraderie between Hufflepuff and Gryffindor is an indicator that Dumbledore s party is capable of standing united to tackle the external adversary whether it is only the harmless fellow wizarding schools or a more nefarious death eater or the ultimate Dark Lord himself No other untoward incident in any of the previous Harry Potter books hurt as much as the horrific death of the charming beloved Cedric Diggory If anything ever made me strongly convinced of the unfairness of the whole affair it was Cedric s death If anything ever made Voldemort utterly inexcusable then it was Cedric s terrible end image error Rowling has always exercised caution in doling out punishments unnecessarily to the undeserving people but maybe she wanted the Triwizard Cup to be a turning point The moment Cedric and Harry touched the cup was also the moment that brought contradictory unhappy feelings to our hitherto always-feel-good Harry Potter moments Maybe Rowling wanted to rouse the bland simmering-beneath-the-surface sentiments of the readers into a raging inferno that is ready to devour the evil Voldemort if the readers ever succeed in finding their platform Nine And Three Quarters UGLY GETS MORE UGLY If for all these days we have been associating words like slime filth crawling-skin with Voldemort things have just gotten slimier filthier and more skin crawling Yeww we finally get to see the devil with its lock stock and barrel Do we like what we see Finally subtlety You gotta learn it from the fraudulent Moody Things are not going to be the same but y all accept that there was a fleeting moment when you wanted to hurl unforgivable curses at him Poor chap Anyway we need to watch out for the slimeball with slits for nose more"

"63","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Aug 07 2016"," Rikke","it was amazing"," This is without a doubt my favorite Harry Potter novel It has been my favorite ever since it came out and it has only improved on rereading I adore it I adore the sense of adventure that spills over every page the expansion of Rowling s magical universe and the subtle changes that mark the book s passage from children s fiction to more mature young adult When I was younger I especially adored the book because it introduced me to other magic societies and international schools of wizardry While Rowling certainly doesn t mention a magic school anywhere near me she opens up for the possibility She expands her universe of wonder she pushes the boundaries and somehow everything seem closer More relatable Magic stops being a distinctly British thing and becomes an international phenomen Something that could perhaps happen to a girl in Denmark as well At least that s what I thought then Rowling s novels are good but they can at times feel very constricted There are very few actual environments described you have the village of Hogsmeade with all its colors and wonders matching up to Diagon Alley you have the muggle life with the Dursley family always dreary boring and painful and you have Hogwarts of course buzzing with energy magic sparks and new adventures At times you have a glimpse of London mixed with a visit at the Weasley s an occasional tale from the dark prison of Azkaban but that s really it Until this book Not only does it introduce new schools and new environments it also takes us to graveyards of horror and Rowling finally mixes her two spheres the muggle world and the wizarding worlds in a glorious game of Quidditch You get to see the union of these two very different worlds and you finally understand how they aren t as separate as one would think how they depend on each other gravitate towards each other and hide each other Constantly It s beautiful And well worth the wait more"
"64","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Mar 26 2013"," Bradley","it was amazing"," Buddy-read and re-read It s Barty Crouch time This is the first time that a non-titular character in Rowling s work becomes the main character crowding out Harry Hermione and Ron altogether He even crowds out the plight of the house elves All Hail Barty Crouch Ahem Sorry I ve been under the Imperius curse For a long time Sorry In fact it s been almost the entire length of this novel I just broke out from under it only to find that my place is a mess and there are approximately 365 pairs of socks draped over all my bookcases Don t ask I loved this book more than the movie alas I especially loved all the times under the Veritus potion where we get a full breakdown of events from Barty s PoV obviously and to a lesser degree the House Elf Liberation Front I feel for you Hermione And of course I miss the fact that Harry s winnings in the Tournament went to the twins I thought that was brilliant in the books and inexplicably missing in the movies Seriously I want to hit something Or at least curse it If you haven t read these books shame on you If you have you feel me Right more"
"65","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Mar 17 2009"," Liza Martin","did not like it"," So after suffering through the first three books of this series I vowed never to carry on and finish it That is until I was at a party and two of my friends gave the Harry Potter saga such a ringing endorsement that I was convinced I was missing out I picked up the fourth book and was determined to read it to reconsider my stance on the series I quickly got through 200 pages but it was then that I came to the same crisis I always do when reading a Harry Potter book Do I really want to go on And as always the answer was no So in keeping with my MO that Life is too short to read books you re not interested in I put it down and have no regrets Sorry Harry and the gang I just have no interest in you or your adventures I guess I never really got this phenomenon and that s OK with me There are better books out there more"
"66","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Dec 17 2015"," Councillor","really liked it"," Believe it or not - yes I finally read the fourth book in the Harry Potter series a book which made me anticipate the next three installments in the series even more eagerly A Harry Potter book is no book you simply read it is a book you are allowed to live in I don t know any fantasy world which feels as realistic as this one While the first three books were comparatively short this one was - so far - the longest with 766 pages 766 pages It felt like 300 considering my pace while rushing through this book Please choose wisely before reading this review There are no specific spoilers but in case you haven t read the first four books in the series you might want to turn away from this review Until now The Goblet of Fire was the Harry Potter book I enjoyed most because it managed to find the perfect point of balance between the dark gloomy and complex plot elements surrounding the return of Vol sorry You Know Who and the light-hearted funny scenes which managed to conjure a smile on my face whenever another one of those appeared during the course of the book Still I couldn t bring myself to rate this with five stars as there were quite a few things which bothered me And yes I know that I am getting myself in severe danger right now with saying this I will better take to my heels and run as fast as I can after posting this review First of all in case you have not already realized this during The Prisoner of Azkaban the Harry Potter series is far away from being a children s book series anymore Especially in the beginning and the ending horror elements outweigh everything else crying at the reader This is no children s book you are reading anymore Well then why does J K Rowling still constantly fall back to the habit of using childish language A short search of the story brought up nearly 1 400 exclamation marks And everytime I stumbled upon yet another one the only thing I could think of was this picture But well by now I have developed a soft spot for Harry Potter books and sometimes childish writing style is not that bad just kind of annoying However quite a few other things bothered me while reading this book and I will now try to go through them as fast as possible After all I have learned one thing about discussions in my school time which still stays with me - list the arguments your reader should forget about first then he will be even more convinced by the positive arguments you will list afterwards Rita Skeeter I am sure just dropping her name makes a lot of fans of the series want her to meet a Dementor However the way she appeared made me think of her as a pure caricature causing nothing but trouble without being even the slightest bit complex simply annoying and not the least obstacle to write as a character because of her one-dimensional appearance I would have loved to see some more insight into her character but sadly J K Rowling decided to just present us with a caricature How could someone as dumb as Fudge be Minister for Magic That s no true criticism After all just look at some of our real world s politicians And yet can someone please lock up Fudge right beside Rita The next tournament should include a World Cup of Perfection Dumbledore would almost certainly win Why isn t Hermione more prominent Certain parts of the books made me wish for her character to have a more major role Now that the reasons for my 4-star-rating are out of the way here comes what I loved about the book DOBBY I know there are quite a few people who didn t like his uncommon behavior but I fell in love with him He is probably the cutest and most adorable character of the entire series and his actions are always based on good-hearted motivations Go Dobby Socks that scream when they stink Definitely my favorite moment of the book DRAGONS There are new characters there are old characters but they all have a certain depth No Rita I am not speaking of you I especially loved how the dynamics between Ron Hermione and Harry were explored by throwing some obstacles for their friendships into the game And this article perfectly highlights why Hermione should have a more prominent role in the books The Triwizard Tournament was pure awesomeness I loved every part of it and I am not ashamed to admit it Almost nothing is predictable in this series I was so sure to find out view spoiler Bagman hide spoiler is the true culprit but J K Rowling took my prediction and shred it to pieces I only wish that my intention to predict things will not continue to be destroyed by spoilers people seem to carelessly leave all over the internet I will leave a huge thank you right here to the person who spoiled all the upcoming deaths in the next three books to me in a review for the second Harry Potter book Thank you There are actually signs of romance Now let s hope there will be some more developments on the romantic level of these books because even though I hate when romantic entanglements are thrown into the story just to make sure the reader roots for the oh-so perfect protagonists these books need some romance Harry Ron and Hermione are teenagers now and I totally want to see them discovering that children aren t born just because two people care about each other I want more of Cho Chang Seriously Hagrid might not be as cute as Dobby but he is certainly just as adorable This has the best world-building ever I never liked the fantasy genre there was even a time which saw me absolutely and whole-heartedly loathing it And then I read Harry Potter Two final thoughts on this book view spoiler An athlete What was the most important moment in the history of sports Me Viktor Krum caught the snitch but Ireland won hide spoiler And finally My reviews in the Harry Potter series 1 Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone Go to review2 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Go to review3 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Go to reviewOrder of the Phoenix here I come more"

"75","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Feb 14 2014"," Vane J","it was amazing"," THIS IS THE BEST HARRY POTTER BOOK OF ALL And the darkest most complex heart-wrenching exciting funniest of them all so far It is also the book in which my reaction after finishing changes from to All that in a matter of a hundred pages For all of you people who have not read these books I need to tell you one thing This damned series has every freaking thing you can think about even horror Yes my friends there s horror of the kind that makes you stare at the book with eyes very wide hands very cold and ragged breathing It wasn t present before Harry Potter wasn t scary but the final chapters of this book were oh so dark and unsettling I know that s how they ll be in the rest of the series yet it doesn t make my surprise smaller You re probably tired of me saying this but I must again say how changed the characters are from how they were three books ago Still in their early teen years but more mature I read this book for the first time more than four years ago and of tge seven books this is the one I remembered the most vividly before rereading That led me to the conclusion I wrote at the beginning of this review This is the best book in the series Actually I am mistaken This is not the best book in the series They grow better the more you read - the complexity and darkness is greater with each book - but for some reason Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire stuck in my memory better than the others had and became my favourite of the series Perhaps it was the Tournament and the tasks or I don t know but it s clear one thing This is the book I love the most in the series Now no more ramblings from me I m off to reread for the first and definitely not last time the fifth book of this magical series more"
"76","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," May 18 2016"," Irene","it was amazing"," Lord Voldemort had risen again Things keep getting darker and darker This book starts right away in a very creepy and disturbing way Hey Nagini nice to meet you that dream was hella scary and we get too a little bit more of Tom Riddle s story Harry is once again stuck in his favorite place ever to spend the summer The Dursleys lolBut of course the are the Weasleys to the rescue and that chapter was simply hilarious In few pages we come face to face with the two missing Weasley brothers Bill and Charlie I almost forget everytime how much they are present in this book First mention of Weasley s Wizard Wheezes aka the coolest place in the planet the twins have already a very clear idea of what they want to do Not all the Weasleys are super cool though and yes I m talking about Percy he s SO concentrated on his work for the Ministry and in pleasing his boss that he practically cares more about that than his family and that s one of the main reasons that Percy is one my least favorite characters of the series It s time to have fun now because Harry this year will attend probably the most important and crowded sport event in the Wizarding World the Quidditch World Cup To get there we are introduced to a new method of transport the Portkey There are here and there some infos about the Apparate test and mentions of people that we will meet later Viktor Krum and there s some Lovegoods mention there too And with this chapter we are fully introduced to Cedric Diggory and his father Amos Following Pottermore s book club discussions of the week one of them was International Magic There s a very festive and happy spirit the day previous the World Cup everyone is in a good mood they are there to have fun and to enjoy the event and the competition too everyone picked his favorite team and will support it till the end it s a very quite chapter that opens us a very cool view about how people attend these events in the Wizarding World During this event we meet two important people for the book and story as well Ludo Bagman and Mr Crouch plus a new house-elf Winky And it s time to follow the epic match between Bulgaria and Ireland with all their named players All the happiness is not gonna last much though soon after the match something will appear in the sky and madness will happen the Dark Mark was shot in the air and the so called Death Eaters are among the people terrorising them There are so many things happening in few pages that oh boy Draco is there all relaxed while everyone else is panicking Hermione is going crazy for the house-elves enslavement Harry lost his wand and Winky was caught with a wand in her hands and in chaos now because Amos thinks that it s all Winky s fault After this crazy night Rita Skeeter is already starting annoying people with her fabulous articles for the Daily Prophet meanwhile Ron will receive that epic dress robes for something that no one will tell them about but seem so damn excited It s finally time to go back to school now Very quickly the students will learn that this year Hogwarts will host a very important event the Triwizard Tournament basically the coolest and most dangerous competition that boys girls d like to take part of After the feast it s time to go back to normal school business and I liked a lot this slow-paced classes part In these pages we learn more of S P E W what it is and how to take part Hermione has as always very clear ideas in her head We meet the new odd professor now Mad-Eye Moody The new DATDA teacher He starts right away with very serious lessons and you can sense the tension between the students We learn the Unforgivable Curses and we get too a probably too real demonstration During these classes there s too a very interesting event Harry can actually block the Imperius Curse Can I mention now the epic ferret scene Hilarious as always lolHogwarts is getting crowded now the two other schools that will compete in the Tournament just arrived We meet for real now Ron s ultimate crush Viktor Krum with his ship and headmaster Igor Karkaroff from Durmstrang and the gorgeous and perfect Fleur Delacour from Beauxbatons with her headmistress Madame Olympe Maxime All the rules are now explained and not everyone can actually access the Globet of Fire to put their name in it to be chosen as one of the three Champions Actually all the boys in our group are making drama after the delusion of how it would be cool to win the Cup and be The Champion some more than others right Fred George That scene was hilarious too but after the very important moment of the choosing all those dreams to Harry are not that funny anymore Of course he was chosen and now Ron is very suspicious on how he actually did it After Harry tells him that he didn t put his name there he is still very angry with his best friend and in here we can actually see that Ron shows a little bit of jealousy towards Harry s popularity and acclamation He actually wants that a little bit too sometimes even if Harry is not recognized for an all happy event or story Ron s of course is human and sometimes the feelings are just too strong to actually think straight Little visit from a familiar face now Sirius Black is back fire edition and tells pretty interesting and informative things to Harry about Karkaroff we learn more about his past and who he really was back in the days Not a shiny past for him either Thanks to Hagrid we now know that the first task is about dragons Harry with the help of Hermione is learning a bunch of new spells that willl come in handy during these situations Accio is pretty useful huh The First Task was successfully passed by everyone even if now they are all wondering what the clue about the second one will be working that one out from the egg they just collected but of course there s plenty of time right Harry Another interesting scene was the kitchen one with the Trio with Dobby and Winky We actually learn so much about how house-elves view their enslavement and in this case Hermione is pretty wrong with all her ideas of freedom and salary There are too a lot of infos about Winky s master in this chapter so it was very informative for a lot of things And who will ever guess that they will attend the most fascinating ball ever this year the Yule Ball and how hard was for our duo back together to find a partner Ron was just hilarious and Harry was actually pretty cute but jeez I truly can t stand Cho Chang oh my god and I don t know why because I actually don t care too much about Harry s romantic decisions lolHagrid is getting closer and closer to Madama Maxime but he makes a terrible mistake he dares to ask her if she is a giantess ups Rita somehow heard of this one and now everyone knows And Harry sees a pretty strange conversation between Snape and Karkaroff where he shows him something on his arm Any guesses After the Ball it s time to focus one again on the Tournament there s not much time left and Harry still hasn t got the clue he needs Cedric in here acts like a friend and tells Harry a hint that will help him But it s thanks to the one and only Moaning Myrtle that he will really listen to what the egg hides Of course for this Harry is out of bed with the egg and Invisibility Cloak During his returning to bed he meets a bounch of -friendly- people plus a mysterious one aka Crouch marked on the Map but Crouch s not there so what theeeee is happening Second task now reaching a friend at the bottom of the lake There are different techniques shown here used by the Champions to actually breath underwater and Harry s was given by the adorable Dobby always ready to help him Harry in here acts just like Harry After passing the obstacles and seeing no one coming and time almost over he wants to save everybody from a very horrible death seriously You just think that during the Tournament the hostages are not all saved they will just drown Oookay Classic Harry haha Thanks to this action though he has tied with Cedric so that was actually pretty convenient in the end And from here things will get darker and darker After Sirius s return Harry will have a very strange and relatively short conversation with Krum They in fact will soon meet a very strange version of Mr Crouch coming out of the forest and soon after Harry is tryikng to reach for Dumbledore as Crouch s wishes but he presumably attacks Krum and they will loose him again it is a very long time since we last saw him and everyone is wondering where he is despite Percy saying proudly that he is simply ill Thanks to this Harry will meet the famous Pensive because when Harry sees something interesting his curiosity has always the best on him and he has basically the need to touch know feel everything so he immerse himself into this liquid that teleports him in what looks like the past We will learn that these are all Dumbledore s memories that he removes from his head One last task Harry come on you are nearly finished The third task is my personal favorite thinking how it s built and that we can actually see the building progression throughout the book but mainly because it s a maze and I love mazes in books Back to the task now Their main objective is to get the Cup that is placed at the centre of the Maze and the first Champion that will reach the Cup and grabs it is the winner of the Tournament and wins a thousand Galleon price After some adventurous time spent in the Maze Harry reaches the Cup and of course Cedric has best timing ever They decide in the end to win together because they helped each other throughout the tasks so they touch the Cup together but they don t know what s waiting for them I still have goosebumps every time I read this chapter because the atmosphere is super dark and creepy There s so much going on in this chapter There s a super creepy and pretty disturbing ritual too I mean just think about it And puff the Dark Lord is back Super emotional scene here and in general you really can feel Harry s pain and desperation How much he wants to do something but he can t do anything and then just how much LV acts like a completely psycho and simply frees him because he has to duel with Harry to destroy him Going further it gets even more emotional during the Priori Incantatem moment where everyone flies out of Lord Voldemort s wand and talks to Harry That part hits you right in the feels really After these terrible and awful moments Harry is immediately taken by Mad-Eye Moody in his office In there things get even more mysterious What does he want now from Harry In this chapter the truth about Moody s identity is revealed and now everyone is worrying about the Dark Lord s return The Ministry is not helping at all Fudge in here is simply terrible and disgusting he refuses to see the reality and he just wants to believe that everything is completely fine and Harry is simply disturbed are you serious The ending continues the very sad atmosphere Only exception is probably Hermione smashing Rita on the window lol And in fact there are no more happy moments in here everyone is cold and scared school is over and it s time to go back home for the holidays This book marks the real comeback of Lord Voldemort After a pretty good summer and the joyful moments at the Quidditch World Cup things for Harry are getting once again very hard at school He finds himself in a Tournament he s not even allowed to take part of and

"90","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Feb 09 2018"," John King","it was amazing"," First The Goblet of Fire is the first exceptionally long Harry Potter book but the constant influx of action drama and tension offsets the lengthiness J K Rowling happens to begin with some early major suspense by sharing how Voldermort is already more powerful than any one could have imagine She happens to do so quite cleverly by using a rat who happens to be-no spoiler However maybe J K Rowling could have added more emphasis to the ritual that raises Voldermort It is skimmed over and she possibly could have utilize more of the dark setting and atmosphere of the ritual to fully illustrate the true evil of Voldermort In addition I believe the emergence of the Moody character serves the good purpose of allowing Rowling to bring together seemingly insignificant pieces and weave them into core elements of the overall story later on Ultimately the Goblet of Fire is when things really begin to manifest in Harry s story His sense of duty becomes more defined making the plot flow in a more structured direction His courage also does not seem to be as reckless as it used to be Finally his relationships with his friends and peers become much more complex as well more"

"95","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Nov 28 2007"," Mariel","it was amazing"," I m a Harry Potter fan A rather hardcore one back in the day The Harry fans at the big meetup of 2007 last book ditched me for not being cool enough Shows what they know I don t know if anyone on goodreads followed the intense Harry Potter fanbase core in the good old days I wasn t on goodreads until after the last book came out Goblet of Fire was the last Harry Potter book before all of the bitching naysayers It was never as much fun after that either to discuss theories or pick apart clues It was also the book that started the I hate Ron club the Draco Malfoy is a conflicted hero idea started around the Chamber of Secrets film Hey I could be a Harry Potter scholar It was pretty much like looking up any movie on the imdb or a tv show on Television Without Pity No one hates something more than an obsessive fan right Fanfic writers who actually preferred their interpretations more than the original source crazy The fanbase could be deterimental to nuturing ones own ohmigod I m going to die without the next book that I so desperately needed Harry Potter was my something to look forward to I haven t found anything else to take its place I ve not tried to hang around the fringes of a big fan base again either My random goodreads tastes probably don t count I have no idea what the big thing is I liked The Hunger Games for the cozy district twelve parts and didn t give a rationed fig for love triangles or political outcome I m a loner bookworm freak Almost as bad were all of the people who felt some pressing need to inform me that they were too cool to even try to read Harry Potter as if it made one bit of difference to me I suspect that I was expected to backtrack You know the way a person will immediately downplay how much they liked or disliked something based on what someone else says about it I was going to read it with or without them They were not beating me by being too cool for school especially if that school is Hogwarts Why were they too cool for Harry after Goblet of Fire The fans I mean I don t remember an awful lot about plot points I m older now and my memory wasn t that good to begin with There is some overlap between books for sure I do remember savoring the details and not because it would help me figure out was going to happen I WANTED surprises Harry disliking Ron for the bit of skin showing between his ankles and his pajama ends That would totally have swayed me to be unwilling to hear an apology and nurse the annoyance another few days I loved it when the whole school hated Harry which is about all of the time I loved how he didn t study and had to work up to the last minute nerve for everything Those kinds of details made it for me I remember the wait between the books and being excited to find out what Neville was up to over the summer long live Neville Longbottom But no the base was miffed cause they didn t get another Sirius Black who owned the motorbike that Hagrid used to escort Harry to Privet Drive appearing in Prisoner of Azkaban If that s what you wanted the appeal of Harry Potter would be dead in the water with the giant squid after the last book That s not me Oh yeah so it was a huge turning point in the series Voldemort rises again the romance shit Rowling s one big flaw in my mind They got longer and less tightly edited we fans were greedy for closer release dates They had no one but themselves to blame Maybe some details got piled on I can t remember which book had the useless James Potter quidditch info Half-blood I think it was the Ron thing anyway D oh It has to be that Maybe it was like season three of Buffy when Buffy goes to L A in the first episode and they still cut back to Sunnydale to show how the Scooby gang are faring without her The new factors of the war is out there situation was like cutting into the Scooby dynamic It s painful to go your own way and be all alone It was like reaching the end half way through Harry has to grow up he has to defeat Lord Voldything and leave Hogwarts And that s a sad feeling cause it means that I also have to leave Hogwarts The bitching had to be about change It still worked it just worked in a different way Change isn t popular There are faults in the series but I loved what I loved so much that I didn t care I just want to be in Hogwarts I could tease about what I didn t like and still loved what I loved How to be a Harry Potter fan in the style of Mariel 101 I m sure I ll be rewarded with my Hogwarts letter any day now D oh Of course S P E W I remember now Society for Promotion of Elvish Welfare for the non-nerds Oh wait those people will not be reading this All the dumbfucks argued that the house elves wanted to be enslaved and that the point of the series was that Hermione was representing America rushing in to save oppressed civilizations when they shouldn t have been involved Dudes they were probably the ones they needed saving from Uggggggh So children should have always slaved away in factories because that was their only wages Because they saw the film Newsies and Christian Bale looked like he was having a lot of fun Killing Mudbloods is bad Sure I don t want to kill kids but wars in the middle east are still a great idea but reading about equality for all is less interesting if it changes the bottom line I probably started resenting the fanbase a whole lot right around that time Rowling could have made the point less hammer-head like via Hermione The films succeeded in that quite well But still It is like being in the wizarding world itself to have read that kind of crap Bigots everywhere Poor Dobby Sobs Winky was fucking annoying though I also didn t mention the Harry is a Death Eater people I wonder where they are right now Probably in a dark corner of the internet somewhere writing about the truth of the Harry Potter series Grrrrrrrrrrrr Harry is all that is good and pure in this world P s I always skipped Quidditch scenes The Triwizard scenes were kinda Quidditch-y to me For that reason Goblet is my least favorite of the series And I hated reading about Ron not liking Harry But still I remember when I got Goblet of Fire I had to go to work and stop reading it I didn t think about anything else but what was going to happen next in this book Every other day was I numb with wanting to be anywhere else That day I was happy to be in my own head Goblet of Fire is a great book by my own definition because of that more"

and the Prisoner of Azkaban 5 stars Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire 5 stars If you want to know what a man s like take a good look at how he treats his inferiors not his equals The fourth Harry Potter book and I have to say I m once again blown away by this series It is my first time reading it but I ve seen the movies a few time so that s why I ve been putting the books off for so long This book was truly amazing the world the humor the characters the heartbreak the challenges the ending It was just astounding and I m so glad there are three more books in this series Warning A lot of praising a head Contains spoilers When I started reading I was at the edge of my seat this scene about the Riddle house read from the muggles perspective was so thrilling As a reader we know it s Voldemort and I was almost screaming at Frank RUN He s dangerous But reading from his pov with his background Urgh it sucked me right back in the story and the world Also the switch between that story line and Harry s was done magnificent I actually expected that after such an epic start the book would slow down a bit and get a tad boring But nothing like that happened and I was so thrilled about this And it was just soooo funny the Weasley s getting stuck in the fireplace sticking so many stamps on the envelop it was entirely covered Fred giving Dudley that candy Bill and Charlie making tables fight each other every scene with Pigwidgeon or Percy lashing out at someone or talking about mr Crouch him calling Percy Wheatherby the Weasley s Wizard Wheezes It was just all so hilarious And can I just say I know I m not the only one but I love the Weasley family so much They are so relatable and funny and loving the personalities clashed so much but they also can t live without each other I loved how much more inside we got about the family Charlie and Bill also got a part in this book I don t think I ve ever read about a family that I want to be part of so bad They made this book so funny and caused such hilarious ridiculous scenes that made me laugh my ass of The scene at the table with the whole Weasley family Harry and Hermione is I think one of my favorite scenes of all time Just the whole atmosphere and the humor and love The beginning of this book was so incredibly well done it deserved 10 stars It matters not what someone is born but what they grow to be Then the Quidditch World Cup was also one of my favorite scenes in the whole HP series Just the atmosphere that was created made me feel part of it I would give almost anything to be part of that The world building in was done so incredibly well things like the tent the Portkeys the omnioculars the Veela and still the whole concept of the Quidditch game is so brilliant and original And besides that this also caused super funny scenes of wizards trying to be as muggle as possible The game was soooo exciting and you re just rooting for Ireland but also for Krum OMG what a pleasure reading After the Quidditch match all Hell broke loose and my heart just skipped a beat The way J K Rowling manages to get me panicked and lost in the chaos just shows how well of a writer she is My heart just stopped when I was reading about the masked men air flowing the muggle family goose bumps I however didn t really get why all the parents left the children in the super dark creepy vulnerable woods alone Even though you can help the ministry and get the bad guys you d still choose to protect your own kid wouldn t you Another thing that slightly bothered me was that Harry Hermione and Ron are again put on in this situation that is extremely convenient Like it doesn t infuriate me but it s still there are 100 000 wands to take and then exactly Harry s wand gets stolen there are probably 10 square kilometers of woods and this person just happens to draw the sign right were the three of them stand I know I know it s exciting for the story but it was just to convenient Getting back to Hogwarts the plot kind off slowed but it never got boring there was still so much world building and excitement happening I love the side plots in this book Hermione s SPEWT organisation the plot about the skrewts and the lessons overall just never tire me And on top of that the announcement of The Triwizard Tournament and the arrival of the other schools I loved the division between the schools and the way they arrived was once again so creative and renewing I actually forgot the whole twist about Krum being a student at the Bulgarian school super cool twist I loved that little old Hagrid liked Maxime that Ron was so star-struck with Krum and the everyone trying to get around the age bounder which caused once again hilarious scenes Harry s name coming out of the cup was however kind of a turnaround in this book Not only does this book get much more mysterious and darker it also grew a tad less fun and I found myself less enjoying it about 200 pages or so in I mean it is still funny and there is still amazing world building and the tests are amazing and creative but I felt that some of the characters got really on my nerves In the previous books in the HP series there are characters I hate to love Malfoy Filch Snape but in this book quite a few character s behavior got on my nerve I didn t understand why Harry didn t fight harder to talk Ron to sense that he didn t do it after the first party I would have shook him awake trying to make my point and Harry is like okay I ve said it twice now not going to repeat it a third time will I I also despised Fleur in the beginning she was really haughtily in the beginning towards Harry but also Hogwarts as a whole complaining about a-ny-thing But also Ron in some ways I like the mc fighting with his her best friend I mean they re human s after all and humans have disagreements and fights So in a series over a time span of 7 years it is understandable that a mc is going to have a disagreement with his friend so props to Rowling for realism However I found this fight annoying to read I get Ron s kind of jealous about Harry and he did think that Harry put his name in so he was mad for not telling him that he did that But as a reader we know Harry is speaking the truth so it was just frustrating that when the whole school despised him Harry couldn t even count on his best friend to believe him And then another character that grew on my nerves and that I wanted to slap like a thousand times was was Rita Seeker I know I know that is what she was created for But I just couldn t stand her every scene she showed up in made me want to close this book I can t believe what lies she wrote about my favorite characters and how she twisted words or silences to her advantage did really like her self writing quill though very creative I can t believe how Rowling turned this around towards the end I was once again mind blown Ron said sorry to Harry after a few weeks Fleur actually wanted to stay in England and grew rather fond of Harry and Rita Seeker got what she deserved by Hermione Time will not slow down when something unpleasant lies ahead So Harry gets chosen by the cup and the only thing that I kept wondering was so what that he got chosen or bewitched why does he have to compete He won t die if he didn t face the dragon right It wasn t really backed up why exactly Harry was forced to be a part of it and why Dumbledore didn t just say it s against the rules on about three different levels so we re going to ignore the cup right now and proceed with the three first champions I think that could have been a bit better explained or thought out I was a little bit disappointed by the Dragon scene first task if I can admit it I ve seen the movie and there the first task was just done epic The dragon is on a chain but the Horntail is so strong it breaks and sets of in the air over the roof after Harry and they are skittering along it Harry fighting for his life But here Harry was never in any danger After about 10 lapses of flying the Horntail took after Harry and he could easily grab the egg The scene was just a bit too short and disappointed for this 600 paged book Another tiny disappointing scene for me was the Yule ball I think Rowling could have done a tiny bit better at describing the scenery like for example the dresses it was all a bit dull and underdeveloped I also don t really get this scene in overall comparison to the plot even though I still liked it I did however LOVE the scene with Hermione and Victor shipped them so hard there for a second I really liked how Rowling put down the characters there and starts to make a foundation for future relationships I also loved the scene where Hagrid showed Harry the dragons and I really admire Harry for telling Cedric and I love even more that it payed of I LOVED the scene with Dobby and Winky in the kitchen I loved the Sirius letters and the concern for Harry he showed how Harry finally has a family member I loved the scene with Harry and Mertle in the bath with the egg I loved the scene where Moody helps Harry when he is invisible on the stairs and is almost discovered by Snape and Filch Numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it The second task lived way more up to my expectations than the first did How Rowling comes up with these crazy original tasks is just mind blowing This one is my favorite I love how brave Harry is and how he was rewarded for being concerned about the other people in the water even though he took longer because he also saved Fleur her sister I loved how Dobby helped him I think that s one of the strong points about HP it has so many good lessons and even though Harry is the chosen one I m never annoyed with him for accomplishing such unbelievable things because he has help he doesn t do everything alone despite what is revealed at the end of this book One of the best things about the HP books is that when you know what the plot is about and your read the books again there are so many hints that you can t believe you ve missed when you first read watched it I mean the basic history lesson from Sirius Dumbledores pensieve the trashcans the fake Moody s hip-flask Snapes storage being broken into And many many more I just can t believe I missed all that the first time around I love when mrs Weasley and Bill showed up for Harry at the third task that made me almost cry with happiness for Harry The third task blew my mind It was so tense and the creatures in the maze were super cool I loved how the Skrewts came into play here I did wish it took a bit longer though just like the first task I would have loved more But it was absolutely brilliant that the cup was a Portkey It just blew my mind And then this scene with Voldemort in the graveyard It made me speechless cry and scream It was so well written This is just one of the best scenes I ve read Ever It made all my little comments from before go away and made me want to give this book 100 stars Cedric dying Wormtails hand Harry s parents the Death Eaters I loved how it came together with the beginning of this book with the house and Frank s story how we got to know more about Voldemort as a child and about his family Everything just clicked in this book and about some of the things in the previous books It was absolutely epic I also really loved how Harry still beat Voldemort and what happened with the wands was brilliant How Cedric asked to take his body to his parents made me cry once more Remember if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy remember what happened to a boy who was good and kind and brave because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort Remember Cedric Diggory But still after that scene ended and Harry took the Portkey back to Hogwarts the tension didn t end Mad Eye Moody appeared to be Crouch s son who was taken away to Azkaban It just made so much sense how his mother sacrificed herself for her son and took his place and he became his father s prisoner I can t believe Mr Crouch let her do that How Crouch junior and Wormtail found Voldemort and brought him back and junior took Moody s place as a teacher to ensure Harry won the cup and took the Portkey to the graveyard Absolutely amazing can t say that enough now can I I m still mad about Fudge s reaction though how can he ignore all these clues that Voldemort is back I did really like how Dumbledore said exactly the right thing And I loved it even more how the people came together in the last few pages Dumbledore Snape madam Pomfkrey McGonagol all the Weasleys Hermione Ron Oh and I loved how Harry gave Fred and George the price money to invest in the WWW I just can t

"110","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Mar 20 2010"," Trish","it was amazing"," As mentioned a couple of times this is a re-read As also mentioned countless times in discussions with other readers this is my favourite Harry Potter volume The density of events - from the aftermath of the previous book to the Quidditch World Cup sport-wise to the end of the Quidditch World Cup The Dark Mark to the Triwizard Tournament to many deeply social political topics - is simply staggering but very well interwoven So yeah as a short summary it is about Harry and his 4th year at Hogwarts We start a few weeks before the summer holidays are over and because Harry had no problem telling the Dursleys that his godfather was a mass murderer the holidays were fairly OK In fact just mentioning Sirius to uncle Vernon is enough to get Harry the permission to spend the remaining 2 weeks with the Weasleys - yes I associate their house with being 100 comfy They are the ones taking Harry to the Quidditch World Cup And here are the first few things where I m torn between liking the book version or the movie version better Advantage of the movie version Less silly pretense of the wizarding world with the muggles over the event I thought that was a bit stupid really and was glad when they finally gave up Advantage of the book version More insight More descriptions of the quirkiness of wizards and the craziness of such a huge event I m not a sports person lover although I do watch the Soccer World Championship every time but the atmosphere left the pages and sucked me right in Then there is the tragic end to the World Cup of course after which we are right back at Hogwarts - home But there we get the next mega event the Triwizard Tournament the cup in the movie is better than the one described in the book We also get new teachers new problems and one of the worst periods in the entire series when view spoiler Ron and Harry don t speak with each other anymore Honestly as thick as Harry often is he should tell people everything right away he was right about not making the first step He never shows off - on the contrary he always feels bad when he has something Ron doesn t - and then he s supposed to make up with Ron when Ron is still jealous Utter nonsense hide spoiler More than that even we get deeply reflective moments thanks to Hermione who changes evolves the most throughout the series and her S P E W movement which goes hand in hand with the whole giant business I like the fact that Rowling wrote about a society with so much potential for greatness but also such deeply dark sides and tremendous flaws How anyone could NOT have immediately thought that Hagrid and Madame Maxime were half-giants is a complete mystery to me by the way And then making the book a thousand times better than the movie we get a much more elaborate and detailed Triwizard Tournament and the champions preparations before each and every task By the way I m always very much put out over the fact that view spoiler it is Neville in the movie who helps Harry with the Gillyweed Dobby being at Hogwarts and how he helps Harry his entire attitude is what redeemed him to me and let me like him later on This was missing from the movies entirely which had a negative impact on my mourning of Dobby in book 7 hide spoiler The book is much less rushed and everything fits seemlessly together One of the most beautiful descriptions - and wonderfully done in the movie as well - is the Yule Ball In fact the weeks leading up to it were far more funny in the movie dancing lessons with McGonagall However the book managed to bring out even more how many people like Harry only for his fame I never liked the Patil girls And you may try to stone me for this but I m saying it anyways I just couldn t bring myself to liking Cedric Diggory let alone his father Sorry Yeah he wasn t as bad as his dad he was sort of modest but he was also eager to step out from the shadow and eager to please and sometimes it showed He certainly was in no way as wonderful as many readers led me to believe I asked them why they had cried so much during the 4th movie because of Cedric back when I hadn t read the books yet and they started fangirling about him Anyway this book had it all funny moments touching moments deeply reflective moments adventure tragedy and heartship a mystery thrilling events a lot of magic if only Harry learned this much every year a fantastic cast of characters and political embroilments through which the bright and the dark side of the wizarding world were shown more than ever Still my favourite of the lot P S Another very important detail completely missing from the movies could have been mentioned in only one line without problem so no idea why they left it out is the fact that view spoiler Harry gives his winnings to the twins so they can start their shop hide spoiler more"

"127","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Jan 07 2016"," Christian Guzman","it was amazing"," If i could give this book more than 5 stars believe me i would Obviously this is because i am a die hard Harry Potter fan so it would be quite impossible for me to dislike any of the novels I did however enjoy Goblet of Fire more than the previous 3 novels This is mainly because of the size of the book and how much more detail there is There s a good mixture of suspense drama adventure and emotion in Goblet of Fire I kind of wish i hadn t seen all the movies prior to reading the books since it spoils many parts of the story There s still so much more detail in the books that obviously can t be put into the films due to timing so i still get to enjoy the books tremendously It s still great getting a more detailed view of the magical world and its many characters I think the Triwizard Tournament chapters were my favorite they were fun to read and interesting to see how the contestants would react to certain circumstances To be exact my favorite one was the second task which took place in the Black Lake The Yule Ball was also interesting and a bit chaotic Hagrid Maxime Hermione and Ron entertained me so much during the Yule Ball chapter I also enjoyed getting to know the backstory of Hagrid s past You feel sympathy towards him as you are reading about him I learned so much about his origin and how he is perceived by other people The house elves contributed a decent amount to the novel i enjoyed reading about them and Winky was funny to me but also frustrated me a bit House elves are strange little creatures I also found the reporter Rita Skeeter to be quite annoying and irritating i am pretty sure that was one of Rowling s objectives when she was developing the character so she excelled at that There s just so much i enjoyed in this novel I won t go into more detail since i don t want this review to end up being eternal and to have spoilers I heard many great reviews about the sequels and i cannot wait to dive into them J K Rowling is by far one of my favorite authors She created such an iconic world more"

"130","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Apr 06 2013"," Angela","it was amazing"," Whereas the previous three books in the series were getting progressively darker leading to this and the future books there s a huge jump in scope and size of this novel And this book is most definitely darker You wouldn t realize it when you start off with the Quidditch World Cup to look forward to It s that as much as anything I think that sets the tone for the book Excitement nerves joy and terror all rolled into one I love how the clues if you re able to add them all up to the right answer are all cleverly imparted within the text Never does it feel like extraneous information but it also doesn t feel important - Of course we come to find out later just how important those pieces of information were If you re one that s only been watching the movies and don t get me wrong I love the movies you re missing out - a lot - here in this story The book is so incredibly big that they had to cut some of the storylines had to shorten and paraphrase others and I think overall it really does suffer for it Yes yes I know - SPEW isn t necessary and doesn t really matter but shrugs I love it I love that storyline I love what it implies and I love what it shows of a certain character That s by no means the only cut that this book suffered when it was translated to the big-screen though There are other things that are softened or made less horrible in the movies - I remember the first time I read the books after having seen the movies I love Snape I always have and always will but it s easier to love Rickman s portrayal of him in the movies He s an ass in the books - abusive at best to his students And let me clarify here I don t love what he does always but he s an excellent character In the movies though he s still a jerk but the best intentions are written all over him And that s kind of unfortunate too Another loss is Ron s shitty behaviour Honestly I d nearly forgotten about his behaviour in this one but his character really stands out to me as not good He constantly believes the stereotypes and rumors and things other people have told him about other magical beings and people He is very hard pressed to form his own opinions He believes the absolute worse of his BEST FRIEND and treats him like shit He mocks and berates his other BEST FRIEND Ugh I don t like you Ron And every time I read the books that dislike gets a little more intense Anywho - let me get off that rant I love this book I love the suspense the tension the mystery I love the tasks - even if there are only three of them I loved learning more about other wizards and their cultures This book really builds towards the climax - and I remember exactly how shocked I was when I reached it the first time I felt sure that it couldn t happen it shouldn t so it wouldn t This book definitely brings out the emotions in me I still tear up near the end and cheer when Harry faces his first task It s hard for me to be objective while reading or reviewing because I love this world so damn much Weasleys picking Harry upWeasleys Wizard WheezesOmniocularsTri-Wizard TournamentRita SkeeterYule BallHermioneCedricPriori IncantatemAnd I can t wait to start Order of the Phoenix next This review can also be found at The Book EatersPrevious thoughts As evidenced by my last three reviews of the Harry Potter novels I suck at this There re so many feels that accompany my readings of these books I m so immersed in the world the characters lives and struggles and triumphs that I can t begin to put together coherent words explaining why or how I feel as I do This review is going to be more of the same This book had me again on the edge of my seat while the tasks were taking place right there with Harry Hermione and Ron as they tried to figure out what was happening more"

"154","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Nov 10 2010"," Emily","it was amazing"," I ve read this book so many times that my copy is quite literally falling apart - the spine is split on one side and there s a section of pages that you have to stuff back in to the center every time you close the book This was always one of the standouts of the series for me because it s just so much fun even as the tone becomes darker It s crazy to think that the first time the term Death Eater appeared was in this book as well as the introduction of the now-familiar Unforgivable Curses Again JKR pulls off her usual plot complexities in a believable way I mean Rita Skeeter as view spoiler a beetle hide spoiler - gah so good - and of course the introduction of Portkeys at the Quidditch World Cup And the ending with Priori Incantatem gets me every time It s emotional and believable and so inventive But though I ve read this one countless times and I love the ever-expanding Potterverse this was weirdly enough my least compelling reread Maybe it s because it was annoying to keep holding together a 700-page book on the muni or because I was too familiar with the plot and wanted to speed through to the less familiar OOTP The flaws of this plot - brilliantly engineered though this book is - were too noticeable this time view spoiler There s this strange tension between everyone believing that whoever entered Harry into the tournament is trying to kill him and the false Moody s mission to get Harry in one piece to the graveyard at the end of the book If false Moody is so determined to get Harry to Voldemort unscathed why bother to enter him in the tournament at all Just bewitch some other Portkey and get him out of the school at the end of the year if Voldemort does indeed need that time to prepare for the ritual hide spoiler more"

"168","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Apr 26 2016"," Stepheny","it was amazing"," Goblet of Fire is almost everyone s favorite Harry Potter book or Prisoner of Azkaban My personal feelings differ but there is literally not a single Harry Potter book that is bad Having re-read these books so many times I have lost count I have to say Goblet is on the lower end of my rankings As it stands now my favorites are in the following order Order Hallows Prince Stone Prisoner Goblet and Chamber Now be mindful of the fact that they ALL get 5 stars We are talking about such a small difference in love it is hardly worth commenting on But I digress In Goblet of Fire we encounter all sorts of new and exciting things We get to see the Quidditch World Cup We get to see Death Eaters tormenting muggles and muggle-borns We get to see just how much work goes into hiding the wizarding world from muggles on an everyday basis We are introduced to Mad-Eye Moody and his intriguing career We have our minds blown at the what-should-have-been-obvious fact that there are OTHER schools throughout the world NOT just Hogwarts Upon his arrival at Hogwarts after the events of the Quidditch World Cup Harry is shocked to hear that there will be no Quidditch this year at Hogwarts However he can barely register his shock when Dumbledore announces that in its stead Hogwarts will be host to an event that has not happened in over a century the TriWizard Tournament Representatives from two other schools will be joining the students and worthy champions will be selected by the Goblet of Fire to compete Rules are aplenty though as we find out just why the tournament has not been held in so long students have died So no student under the age of 17 is permitted to enter their name into the goblet So how does it happen that Harry s name comes floating out of that Goblet Being 3 years younger than his fellow champions surely puts him at a disadvantage There must be dark magic involved Someone is out to kill Harry Goblet of Fire is a fast-paced and exciting read a wonderful addition to the series and a crucial one The series starts to take a dark turn here and is just the tip of the iceberg for what happens in the next three Delee is a first-timer to the series and was supposed to read this one with me but life happens sometimes and it got set aside temporarily She s lucky I love her as much as I do or she d be locked in my basement with Mr King and that MahFah Jeff But I decided to give her a pass this time more"

BIG FUCKING MOOD I was trying to see the Hermione and Fred ship in this and I have to say they had their moments Harry auditioning for High School Musical 2 I don t dance Professor Ginny stopped smiling when she realized that Harry had the hots for Cho my poor baby your time will come I hate that Hermione let Poppy shrink her teeth I hate it so fucking much Dumby mentioning the Rom of Requirements - I am living for all of this foreshadowing Fred and Angelina dancing exuberantly at the Yule Ball - I LOVE THEM Ludo Bagman dancing with Maggy - I want to see that Snape being on duty to make sure the teens weren t making out I died Ron and Hermione fighting in the common room after the Yule Ball and not on the steps in public totally forgot that Aberforth practising inappropriate charms on a goat is the biggest mood out there Hagrid having so much trust and faith in Harry s capability to win - I FUCKING CRIED FOR REAL Harry Potter has to go into the lake and find his Wheezy 3 3 3 Dobby being at Hogwarts again was honestly a deal breaker for me I need more Dobby content Dumby speaking Mermish is everything There you go Harry Ron shouted over the noise You weren t being thick after all - you were showing moral fibre That s the comedic relief I need in my life Viktor and Hermione is a wholesome ship - I love how mature she was about the whole situation and Rita spreading lies about her but the age gap is nasty there s no way around it Padfoot living off rats oh my lawd If you want to know what a man is like take a look at how he treats his inferiors not his equals I have to say the Sirius moments were golden in this one not the biggest fan of him in OotP BUT in Goblet he delivered Mrs Weasley treating Hermione differently after Rita published lies about her made me so mad honestly the only situation where I was sooo pissed off at Molly Krum being interested if Harry ever fucked Hermione I was like wtf can this man chill Karkaroff spitting at Dumbledore and Hagrid ripping him a new one as if it were nothing Fawkes is THE SIZE OF A SWAN what a queen Neville s subplot about Harry finding out about the Madness of his parents had me sobbing Fleur and Bill are my favorite ship in the entire series and seeing them hitting it off in Goblet made my heart singgggg Mrs Weasley recounting the story of how she and Arthur sneaked out during their time at Hogwarts and got caught and Arthur still got the whipping marks from the whipping he got from the then-care taker LIKE WTF HOW FUCKED UP IS THIS SCHOOL Dumbledore invoked ancient magic to ensure the boy s protection as long as he is in his relations care - I assume this has to do with Petunia and Lily coming from the same blood Nevertheless Dumby could have made sure Harry wasn t fucking abused in their home At the final Priori Incantatem Lily should ve appeared before James since she died last The way Barty Crouch Sr abused his own son putting him under the Imperius curse he shouldn t have bothered to save him at all like what s the point if he s going to live so miserably and you don t give a shit about him WHY HAD DUMBY A LOOK OF TRIUMPH IN HIS FACE after Harry told him that Voldemort could touch him now p 604 I NEED ANSWERS Harry and Voldy s wands were made from Fawkes feathers When Harry recounts seeing his parents again and Sirius fucking losing it - I LOST IT AS WELL Bill has so much swag POPPY POMFREY IS MY QUEEN she truly deserves better Lie low at Lupins - ALLLRIGHHHHT You re alright - Yeah - No you re not Of course you re not but you will be -

I LOVE MY PURE SON REVIEW OCTOBER 2015 Oh man I just remembered why I re-read this last year not that you need a reason to re-read friggin HARRY POTTER but well I had one I woke up one night at 3 AM and simply had the urge to read Goblet of Fire I started reading it in April but then college got in the way and I stopped AND I COLDN T GO BACK TO SLEEP I had to read this and I binge-read the whole thing and it was beautiful Goblet is one of those books were I genuinely think that the movie did a pretty darn good job at portraying the atmosphere and getting things right Goblet is actually one of my favorite movies because the two other Wizarding Schools are portrayed in such an intriguing way and the whole Tournament is so fun and interesting and the introduction of the Dark Lord was just amazing but for some reason Goblet isn t my favorite book I can t even tell you why This was also one of the first times that I actually recall MOURNING FOR CEDRIC DIGGORY I always thought that his death was sad but it never reaaaaally hit me but this time man I was sobbing on the floor and couldn t contain myself Cedric fucking Diggory is such a hero I loved that he basically made Hufflepuff cool and sexy Not that I was one of those people that dislikes Hufflepuff finds it boring but still he made Hufflepuff a lot more interesting D more"

"197","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Apr 01 2013"," Krystal","liked it"," Boys and girls prepare to say farewell to your childhood This book is a rollercoaster of emotions but one thing is certain it will leave you with the feeling that this series has most definitely graduated from a children s book series These are not happy fun magical times any more The start is a little slow and boring because it s all about Quidditch The whole episode drags on for the first hundred or so pages of this startlingly larger novel setting us up for a looooong ride It also introduces the much darker tone fairly early with dark marks Death Eaters and missing people I think looking back I like the idea of this novel more than actually reading it I mentioned in my first delayed review that it was my fave - I take it back 3 rates higher The first half is a bit of a chore and as much as I love the episode with the dragons it s not really enough to amp up the excitement levels overall Once again the novelty of magic seems to have gone and we have to wade through a fair bit of doom and gloom Plus Ron s sulking and Harry has dialed the angst-metre waaaaaay up so really there s only Hermione and the twins providing some decent sass and comedy I m a big fan of Sirius so it s pretty disappointing that all he gets is a bunch of letters and a couple of cameos Cedric on the other hand is a lot of fun so I guess that kind of makes up for it Could have used more Cedric though too I probably would have preferred Cedric Diggory and the Goblet of Fire but hey I guess we get what we re given sigh view spoiler Obviously a heart breaking moment when we finally get a fun new character and he s killed off in a sentence What a way to go out I get really mad about his death It was such a waste and absolute rubbish that it was just wrong place wrong time hide spoiler I really like the idea of the tournament but it was a bit anti climatic I mean there s only three tasks This book could have been so much more action-packed but instead it was taken up with Harry moping and having tantrums and talking to teachers WHAT a Teacher s Pet too I have to say No wonder the other kids turn on him so easily I love tournaments and puzzles and challenges and things so this was a bit of a let down The dragons though I love dragons I m definitely with Hagrid on this one - it would be so cool to have a pet dragon Mad Eye Moody is a total badass and I like him a lot even if he does kiss Harry s ass a fair bit The ferret incident was hilarious I m really not a fan of the bipolar characterisation of Snape though Like I get that he hates Harry or whatever but overall he s a decent guy and actually does his job well He looks after people that aren t Harry So why make him do douchy things It doesn t fit with the character to me I still love him though Dumbledore is still making poor choices and is a classic case of easier to get forgiveness than permission Plus he s supposed to be super intelligent and all he comes up with is an age line So disappointing I feel like there were a lot of missed opportunities for interesting magic in this book and a lot of dumb often pointless decisions Also view spoiler I thought portkeys were timed Pre-determined time and location and all that How come all those rules went out the window at the end of the book hide spoiler Krum and Fleur are interesting but barely fleshed out so that was a shame There s all these fantastic characters being introduced but Harry s so antisocial he only converses with people we ve known for the past three books so again it s a bit of a wasted opportunity I wish this kid got out more to be honest If only he was more likable Overall - Slow start- Much darker- Less magic- More dragons- More angst- Some fun characters- Ron is a total drama queen- Hermione gets a makeover- Harry is still a douchebag- so much more drama oh my looooordThe ending though is such a drastic turn of events it hooks you in so that by the time you finish reading you re sitting there going hang on wha wait what just happened So that s it Goodbye sweet innocent magic Goodbye fun lightheartedness Time to grow up Original delayed review This is actually my favourite book in the series because um dragons are cool and when you throw one in you kinda win me over Also Cedric is cool Mostly Harry s still an annoying self-centred jerk but four books in you kinda get used to it Ron is a bit of a sook but Hermione s feistyness balances it out which is a relief There s a lot of teen angsty drama though which honestly who can be bothered The kids from the other schools are interesting though The trials are just cool mostly because of the dragons and it s just a bit of FUN before all the doom and gloom of the last few novels This is where the childhood disappears my friends more"

"228","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Feb 05 2015"," Jonathan Terrington","really liked it"," I wasn t a huge fan of the preceding books in the Harry Potter franchise I appreciated the worldbuilding certainly but felt underwhelmed by the characterization the writing and the plotting The writing seemed to lack subtlety and nuance in certain places becoming rather cheesy rather than charming as Rowling wished to allude to Further the fact that you have heroes in these novels who are witches and wizards without a sense of proper limitation on their power aside from that some witches and wizards are just stronger and naturally better than others irked me But that all said I finally found plenty more to enjoy in this fourth novel in the series and am already moving onto the fifth novel The strength of this novel is in the overall worldbuilding Rowling has created a world of magic that you would almost want to visit yet in the previous novels I also felt that this magical world was too safe Sure you had trolls dragons and werewolves but there wasn t this real sense of danger Not so with The Goblet of Fire Indeed everything from characterization plotting and overall writing seems to have improved in this novel - although Rowling also becomes much more incredibly lengthy in how she writes I m rather glad this all said that I didn t read these novels when they were hyped up exercises in marketing I feel that I would have been disappointed in returning to read them again as a young adult in my early twenties as it were Not to mention that I previously had little desire to dive into the world of these novels So that all said I would actually recommend getting young teens rather than children to read these novels by themselves or would use them and read them with young children I would however prefer to direct teens to other books that I find to be better on the whole but you can t deny there is a certain charm to these novels that rubs off on the reader They feel somewhat like timeless children s novels and I have no doubt that they will continue to be read in the future more"

"242","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Dec 07 2007"," Alejandro","it was amazing"," How can I choose just one book of the entire series of Harry Potter How HOW I was choosing the books for my Favorites shelf and when I came to choose one single book of Potter series I realized that I was in troubles serious troubles I didn t want to put the all 7 books in the shelf since I wanted to use the Favorites shelf as my face or introductory card in the profile page and I wanted to stick to just 10 books Those 10 books may change in the road at least 2 or 3 of them but I wanted to have just 10 books in that shelf to denote how special those books are for me for different reasons and well to burn 7 spaces in the Harry Potter books wasn t something that I like to do so I chose to use the 4th book as a representant of the entire series And by that the following review will be about the whole series and not limited to the 4th book Don t worry there aren t spoilers Well my reading of Harry Potter books was magical pun intended and it was a return to serious active reading duties I have been reader all my life but for some time maybe a couple of years I was like out of the hype of being reading something much less some book that it was a phenomenon in the readers world Usually my novels were horror books by Dean Koontz Star Trek novels or Buffy the Vampire Slayer novels so I was like out of what was the rush in current readers world I was watching the films but I hadn t read the books However a friend lent me the first book after I had watched the 4th film and WOW I couldn t believe how good was the first book The adaptation to film was very well done here but the prose and style of JK Rowling was magical pun intended again and then I knew that I had to read the rest of the books I started to buy the following books later I got my own copy of the first one for the collection when I went to watch the 5th film I already read the book It was a different experience Okay I love the first book and I was way tempted to use that one as the representant in the favorites shelf I like the second book it s just that since Hermione is my favorite character well there are stuff there that put me out of interest at some point of the book but still it s a very good book and one of the darkest of the series The third book is amazing and easily one of the best written in the entire series connecting a LOT of stuff that you even met in previous books The fourth book is wonderful due the inclusion of the other schools of magic I felt that the world of Potter just got bigger and the whole competition thing is awesome The 5th book is some of my most stressful experiences in my life Not really I felt really trapped without an exit in that book But it s a proof of how good JK Rowling writes since anyone who can provoke that kind of feelings while you re reading a book is mag mmh oh what the heck It s magical Hehehe Also in the 5th book I got two other wonderful new characters as Luna and Tonks My only critique to Rowling is about those two characters that both started so amazing that I think that at some point Rowling was worried that some of those two or both could get more popular with fans than Hermione so you feel in the 6th and 7th books that their roles and time on scenes are at minimum Since I was so stressed after reading the 5th book I embrace the 6th book with a lot of happiness and finally I was glad to see how cool the life can be for Harry finally at least for a time and knowing the origin of you-know-who was awesome it s a great tragedy I ran to the library the day that the 7th book was out and I read it like in 3 days totally disconnected from internet or news to avoid to be spoiled of anything in the final book and to be honest it s my least favorite book of the series I don t know if was because to read it so quick or because I didn t like much of the events there There are like 3 chapters that I liked a lot in the 7th book but honestly it was dissapointing to be reading like for a month a lot of podcasts of Rowling explaining a lot of stuff that she forgot to resolve in the book I think that using a test reading group to check what things she was missing to explain and to resolve could be valuable It was the final book Oh well I love the books Rowling rules Something wicked this way comes when I started to read this magical series more"
"243","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Jan 26 2013"," Becky","it was amazing"," Once again this book is awesome It s the turning point in the series The place where SHIT GETS REAL We see Harry go through some real challenges in this book and not just the ones that Voldy cooked up through his devious evility but challenges that any normal teen may go through jealousy a strained-to-the-breaking-point friendship a crush and bullying and that s a day in Harry s life BEFORE anyone tries to kill him There s something about these books that just pulls my heartstrings too and his name is Ron I love love love love Ron He is my favorite character by far of the series It breaks my heart a little to see him wearing too-short PJs and it s embarrassing to me both on Ron s behalf and for Harry to know that Harry sees it acknowledges and pities Ron for it but disregards it in his anger And Ron s reaction to Harry s anger or lack of one speaks volumes and breaks my heart still more And this is the kind of thing that I love about JKR s writing That scene seems so simple on the surface - Ron interrupts Harry when he s trying to talk to Snuffles and since Ron has been acting like a jerk Harry uses the interruption to vent his frustration But what s implied and what s NOT said are what makes the scene so emotionally powerful to me And every single time I tear up There are some things that I noticed on this 374th reading of the book that stood out as improbable like how does Voldemort keep his wand for 13 years of being incorporeal Someone else would have had to have held onto it for him but if that s the case why wouldn t they have helped him arise again And likewise I find it hard to believe that Voldy did ZERO magic between killing Lily Potter and then killing Bertha Jorkins 13 years later Priori Incantatem shows the spells that a wand has performed It showed the hand that Voldemort had conjured for Wormtail and screaming to indicate the Cruciatus curse he used on Harry so why did it not reflect any of the magic he d have had to do to get to Bertha s memories Likely this is just due to the amount of time that it would have needed to show them all but some sort of explanation would be better than none But still I love this book and there s a reason why it was my favorite for so long I love the emotional impact of this book and how draining it is to read I love that I finish this book with tears in my eyes and an ache in my heart for the things that I know are coming but I can t help but want more more"

"248","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Aug 18 2015"," Carol","it was amazing"," 4 5 STARS The beginning of this book I hard trouble connecting and getting into the story but after passing the 50 mark something clicked and I was GONE The fourth movie is my favorite movie out of the series so I thought this was going to be my favorite book as well but unfortunately it did not I will say that this book had different things happened than in the movie so I enjoyed that very much I thought I had everything figured out but I was most certainly surprised every time there was a plot twist The ending left me wanting to read next book in the series the Order of the Phoenix But is hella long so I think I will pick it up once the new year comes around but we shall see Also the character development of the side characters blew my mind in this book specially for Hagrid who went through so much in his childhood more"
"249","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," May 24 2017"," - caro -","it was amazing"," I don t think I have to write much about this book It s just so good probably my favourite out of all seven HP books Everything was planned out perfectly the world is truly magical and you actually believe this world exists somewhere somehow I feel like in the fourth book you realise for the first time that all the characters have grown up a lot as you can see in the movies as well Rowling also gives us so many new plot twists charcters Winky Krum Fleur etc and you learn a lot about the political situation in the wizarding world which is really fascinating So yes definetely a five star rating for HP and the Goblet of Fire more"

Avada Kedavra Imperius and Cruciatus - are known as the Unforgivable Curses The use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban That s what you re up against -----------------------------------------------------MOMENT 10 Spew said Harry picking up a badge and looking at it What s this about Not spew said Hermione impatiently It s S - P - E - W Stands for the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare -----------------------------------------------------MOMENT 11 I don t believe it Ron said in a stunned voice Krum Harry Viktor Krum -----------------------------------------------------MOMENT 12 Dumbledore reached inside and pulled out a large roughly hewn wooden cup It would have been entirely unremarkable had it not been full to the brim with dancing blue-white flames -----------------------------------------------------MOMENT 13 - but next moment there was a loud sizzling sound and both twins were hurled out of the golden circle as though they had been thrown by an invisible shot-putter They landed painfully ten feet away on the cold stone floor and to add insult to injury there was a loud popping noise and both of them sprouted identical long white beards -----------------------------------------------------MOMENT 15 And then Dumbledore cleared his throat and read out - Harry Potter ---------------------------------------------------- MOMENT 16 The Four Champions -----------------------------------------------------MOMENT 17 Dumbledore cried Rita Skeeter with every appearance of delight I hope you saw my piece over the summer about the International Confederation of Wizards Conference Enchantingly nasty said Dumbledore his eyes twinkling I particularly enjoyed your description of me as an obsolete dingbat -----------------------------------------------------MOMENT 18 but I tell you this I don t envy the one who gets the Horntail Vicious thing It s back end s as dangerous as its front look -----------------------------------------------------MOMENT 19 The First Task -----------------------------------------------------MOMENT 20 The Unexpected Task The Yule Ball is of course a chance for all of us to -

Hermione will you give it a rest with the elf said Ron But Sirius shook his head and said She s got the measure of Crouch better than you have Ron -----------------------------------------------------MOMENT 27 This is called a Pensieve One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one s mind pours them into the basin and examines them at one s leisure -----------------------------------------------------MOMENT 28 The Third Task -----------------------------------------------------MOMENT 29 Cedric was lying spread-eagled on the ground beside him He was dead -----------------------------------------------------MOMENT 30 and Harry stared back into the face that had haunted his nightmares for three years Whiter than a skull with wide livid scarlet eyes and a nose that was as flat as a snake s with slits for nostrils Lord Voldemort had risen again -----------------------------------------------------MOMENT 31 His mother left upon him the traces of her sacrifice this is old magic I should have remembered it I was foolish to overlook it but no matter I can touch him now -----------------------------------------------------MOMENT 32 And as he heard Voldemort draw nearer still he knew one thing only and it was beyond fear or reason - he was not going to die crouching here like a child playing hide-and-seek he was going to die upright like his father and he was going to die trying to defend himself even if no defense was possible -----------------------------------------------------MOMENT 33 Priori Incantatem When the connection is broken we will linger for only moments but we will give you time you must get to the Portkey it will return you to Hogwarts do you understand Harry -----------------------------------------------------MOMENT 34 -----------------------------------------------------MOMENT 35 Harry saw a man lying before him pale-skinned slightly freckled with a mop of fair hair He knew who he was -----------------------------------------------------MOMENT 36 The Parting of the Ways I tell you now - take the steps I have suggested and you will be remembered in office or out as one of the bravest and greatest Ministers for Magic we have ever known Fail to act - and history will remember you as the man who stepped aside and allowed Voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild -----------------------------------------------------MOMENT 37 It is my belief however that the truth is generally preferable to lies and that any attempt to pretend that Cedric died as a result of an accident or some sort of blunder is an insult to his memory -----------------------------------------------------MOMENT 38 -----------------------------------------------------MOMENT 39 Lord Voldemort s gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust -----------------------------------------------------MOMENT 40 Listen said Harry firmly If you don t take it I m throwing it down the drain I don t want it and I don t need it But I could do with a few laughs We could all do with a few laughs I ve got a feeling we re going to need them more than usual before long ----------------------------------------------------- more"

"275","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Jul 06 2012"," Mel","it was amazing"," Gosh I love book 4 It s still got such a happy tone but it s the start of the dark stuff Not to mention I love the tasks and meeting other wizards from other countries Once again here are little tidbits about the book and some things I noticed differing from the movie -I think it would have been important for the movie to tell us that the house at the beginning is the Riddle house -I am noticing this as a trend in every book in the book it s Harry s idea to write to Sirius about his scar hurting and yet in the movie it s Hermione s idea It makes it look like Harry is too dumb to figure it out and that Hermione is the one that has to think for them all It undermines Harry and Ron and I don t really see why they continuously do this every movie -I love that JK developed the Dursley s as characters so well when they are not really central to the story at all -Watching the Weasley s with the muggle world is always hilarious The entire scene when they pick up Harry is hilarious I m upset it s not in the movie because it s the best scene -I love that Harry taunts the Dursley s with Sirius to get them to be nicer to him -I wish they included Bill and Charlie in the movies We never get to meet Charlie and Bill is only a small figure in the last 2 movies It was fun meeting them at the triwizard tournament And of course more Percy which the movie has too little of anyways -I love Pidwidgeon so much and I am sad he wasn t in the movie -The movies don t ever explain what apparating is or how when they learn it Not to mention that they never explain splinching even when it happens to Ron -Since a random old boot is their portkey I ll always wonder if trash on the street is a portkey -They always ask Harry for muggle help even though Hermione is also a muggle Why not also ask Hermione -Super curious if Dean and Seamus were ever really gay -I LOVE that Barty Crouch calls Percy Weatherby -I don t get it in the movie where Draco has to comment how poor the seats are and how they have seats in the ministers box when the teams come out of their seat And lets not forget in the book that they are all in the SAME box -Winky though 3 precious-Veela are hilarious I would have liked to see them and even a LITTLE bit of the world cup stuff in the movie -The entire dark mark death eaters scene was horribly done -S P E W - I will forgive Hermione for this It was one of the most irritating things to read She had sincere intentions but was really annoying with it after a while Everyone including the house elves TOLD her that they don t want to be paid -Hedwig s sass is my favourite -The Goblet of Fire Tournament stuff is all out of order in the movie -I hate that classes become so unimportant in the movies starting now Classes are the best part sometimes -Why are the Pavil twins in the same house in the movie And also they aren t identical in the movie but they are in the book -Why is Beauxbatons an all girl school Is it so hard to imagine that the cup picked a girl Or is it only possible that a girl would be picked if there was no other choice Clearly ridiculous And why is Durmstrang an all boy school though -Everyone s most hated thing HARRY DID YOU PUT YOU NAME IN THE GOBLET OF FIRE said Dumbledore calmly yeah real calm movie -Why was Harry so stressed in the book about the summoning spell for his broom Worrying that it might not make it all the way Like get Hermione to hide your broom somewhere near by so you know it ll be quicker -The entire first task scene was horrible in the movie The rooftop showdown wtf -There was also no point system -I wonder why the Yule ball was only open to fourth years and above Would it have only been 6 7 years if Harry wasn t in it -So umm everyone wants to go to the ball with Harry in the book and no one does in the movie -Hermione s PERIWINKLE BLUE dress I wish we saw that -The best thing though is Herm-Own-Ninny-Maxine Hagrid fighting over being a giant would have been fun in the movie -which makes me wonder how Hagrid s mom had sex with his dad like I am really curious about this -The movie entirely cut out Ludo Bagman like he was not important at all -I prefer book Dumbledore to movie Dumbledore Movie Dumbledore is kind of an ass -Does Harry ever get his Mauraders Map back from Moody -Also why is Hermione Krum s closest person That s weird -Dobby is so precious I m sad they cut him out of the movies -Krum talking to Harry about his flying would have been fun -Krum says your ministry does that mean that each country has their own -What do Ron and Hermione end up doing as jobs when they graduate im sure this will be answered to me eventually -I love that in the end Mrs Weasley got Hermione and Harry as children too You can tell that she wanted Ron and Hermione together all along though because she gets mad at Hermione for dating Harry -If they know Lucius Malfoy is a death eater why do they continue to let Draco come back to Hogwarts -The Graveyard scene was actually well done in the movie surprisingly -Clearly the Potter gene is really strong since his mom and his wife have red hair and his children still have dark hair -I don t see why they cut out the Winky Crouch story at the end it s really quite important the the events of the movie -They basically cut out Sirius from the movie and that pisses me off he s so prominent in the movie the end especially -Also why does Harry never cry That seems a little unrealistic to me tbh -The movies just never say what happens to Crouch JR -I like that they set up the Order a bit at the end even though the reader doesn t really know about it yet -I liked reading that Dumbledore makes Harry go back to the Dursley s ever summer and I liked knowing that Mrs Weasley at least invites him for Christmas and Summer -I am sad the movie cut out so much Krum he seems like a stupid dumbbell in the movies but he s really actually great in the movies Plus I liked his and Hermione s romance -I just wish more than anything we see Harry giving Fred and George the money from his winning because that explains their storyline so much but nope movie just makes it look like Fred and George have always been rich Time for book 5 Not my favourite at all but still looking forward to it more"

"284","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Jan 07 2012"," Janie Johnson","it was amazing"," This is book 4 in the Harry Potter series and Wow it is hard to believe that the first time I only rated this book a 3 What was wrong with me So far I think this was my favorite of the series I can t believe how much I have ventured out in the world of books making myself better understand different genres This book is brilliant really I love Rowling s writing style a lot This book was so engaging for me that it was super hard to have to put it down when I had to go adulting with work I felt as though I crawled inside of the book and lived there Loved the adventure and excitement If people don t like the characters of this series then they are nuts The characters have such great personality so great that you feel like they really do exist outside of the book Like they could be your friends family and in some cases your real enemies as well I think the characters are probably my favorite part of the series because Rowling makes them feel so real even though we journey into a make believe realm of magic I can think of no other place I would rather exist among such a wide array of characters protagonist and antagonists alike I can t help but recommend this book and the whole series to other readers Especially if maybe you read it already and did not really care for it Pick them back up and start the adventure again you may discover that you quite enjoy joining in on all the magic again I know I did more"
"285","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"," Sep 26 2017"," Adam Goldfarb","it was amazing"," This is my favorite of the series Why We finally get to see all that the wizard of world has to offer Dragons Sphinxes and mermaids oh my This is also the book of all books that absolutely crushes any hopes of the films being as good The scope of the book was absolutely epic The quidditch World Cup each event of the Triwizard tournament and as incredible as David Tennent is sorry Matt Smith even he couldn t bring the gravitas to Crouch Jr as the character in the book but he was fantastic This book expanded the world of Harry Potter exponentially Just the background of the World Cup of wizards from all over the world was enough detail to show us the massive size of the wizarding world Hogwarts is a microcosm of the incredible and detailed world that we are privileged to explore with JK Rowling In addition the new magical creatures Voldemort s increased threat level all come to bring the world of Hogwarts to a global scale What is so wonderful about these books is that they grow with their audience The older we get the darker the books get as the characters become more mature and face greater challenges and dangers Definitely a high point of the series Also I could reread the third task over and over So many amazing and magical things happening in such a short time Absolutely wonderful more"
